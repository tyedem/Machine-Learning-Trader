5,secto10,CanadianInvestor,"GUYS CHECK OUT UGE.V, WHICH IS UGE INTERNATIONAL, A FAST GROWING CANADIAN SOLAR ENERGY COMPANY FOCUSING ON THE U.S MARKET. FROM A FUNDEMANTAL PERSPECTIVE, THE MARKET CAP IS ONLY $48 MILLION CURRENTLY, WHICH IS EXTEREMLY UNDERVALUED. IN ITS LAST QUARTER, UGE ANNOUNCED THEY HAVE A GIANT BACKLOG OF SIGNED PROJECTS WHICH IS $110 MILLION WHICH IS A 200% INCREASE. EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVELY, THESE CONTRACTS ARE SIGNED FOR 20-25 YEARS AND PRODUCE REOCCURRING REVENUE EVERY MONTH FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THIS DURATION. INVESTORS TYPICALLY PAY MUCH HIGHER VALUATIONS FOR REOCCURRING REVENUES, AS EVIDENT BY THE LARGE INCREASE IN AAPL STOCK AFTER THEY FOCUSED ON THEIR REOCCURRING SERVICES SIDE OF THE BUSINESS. ALSO, AFTER ADOPTING A REOCCURRING REVENUE MODEL THEIR GROSS MARGINS INCREASED TO A VERY IMPRESSIVE 48%. THEIR GROWTH WILL CONTINUE TO GROW EFFORTLESSLY AND EXPONENTIALLY AS BUSINESSES WILL IMMEDIATELY REDUCE THEIR COST OF ENERGY AT NO UPFRONT COST TO THEM, A PROPOSITION BUSINESSES CANNOT IGNORE. FINALLY, I BELIEVE THE STOCK IS READY TO EXPLODE DUE TO THE TIGHT CAPITAL STRUCTURE – JUST 26.6 MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING, WITH MORE THAN 50% OF THOSE BEING HELD BY INSIDERS. IF THAT'S NOT ENOUGH, ONE OF THE BIGGEST ADVOCATES AND SHAREHOLDERS OF THIS STOCK IS THE ROBERT MCWHIRTER WHO IS WELL KNOWN FOR FINDING SMALL CAPS WITH LARGE FUTURE GROWTH. HE HAS BOUGHT INTO EVERY FINANCING ROUND AND HAS MANAGED OVER $2.3 BILLION IN HIS FUNDS. LET'S ALSO NOT FORGET THAT BIDEN PLEDGED TO SPEND $2 TRILLION DOLLARS ON RENEWABLE ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WILL DIRECTLY BENEFIT UGE. 

FROM A TECHNICAL PERSPECTIVE, IT IS EVEN MORE BULLISH. THE STOCK IS CURRENTLY IN A BULL FLAG PATTERN ON THE DAILY CHART AND IS READY TO EXPLODE. A CONTINUATION OF THIS MOVE WILL SEND IT TO $3.4 WITHIN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, AN ALMOST 100% GAIN. ON A LONGER TERM PERSPECTIVE IT IS ABOVE ALL THE MAJOR MOVING AVERAGES ON THE WEEKLY CHART WHICH SHOULD CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL DYNAMIC SUPPORT AS THE STOCK CONTINUES TO EXPLODE.

* 20%: RIO.UN.TO. SORT OF A HIGHER-RISK PORTION, AIMING AT 100-150% RETURN FOR THE COMING 5 YEARS. JUST TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE RECENT PRICE DROP DUE TO COVID, WITH DIVIDEND SET TO REINVEST FOR MORE SHARES (OF COURSE, THIS IS PUT IN TFSA).
* 15%: STILL IN ZSP.TO. I WILL BASICALLY CONTINUE MAKING MONTHLY PURCHASES JUST AS A REGULAR SAVING. WHEN THE SAVING BECOMES SIZABLE, I WILL NORBERT IT AND BUY MORE US TECH STOCKS.
* 5%: A LITTLE CASH, ALSO SOME YOLO BETS JUST FOR THE FUN OF IT (E.G. SOME CALL OPTIONS EXPIRING IN 1-2 YEARS). MY BELIEF IS THAT YOLO BETS ARE AT LEAST BETTER THAN WASTING MONEY ON LOTTERY TICKETS. STILL, THE ABSOLUTE VALUE OF YOLO IS LIMITED BELOW $2000 (BUT I DO ENJOY R/WALLSTREETBETS).

OVERALL, I'D SAY IT'S SLIGHTLY ON THE AGGRESSIVE SIDE, BUT THE PORTFOLIO SUITS MY RISK-RETURN APPETITE AND OBJECTIVES. OTHER THAN THE TECH INDUSTRY, I FIND IT VERY CONSUMING (TIME AND MENTALLY) TO PICK INDIVIDUAL STOCKS, AND THE RETURN MIGHT STILL BE WORSE THAN SIMPLY BUYING A MARKET ETF.

EDIT (ADDED): I THINK MINE IS PRETTY SIMILAR TO OP, EXCEPT THE ESPORTS PART (I AM CURIOUS ABOUT HOW MUCH IT WOULD RETURN, WILL KEEP AN EYE ON IT).",g4ukv1n,t3_iqu7cp,1599849039,1599874239.0,/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/iqu7cp/seeking_advice_equity_diversification_by_sector/g4ukv1n/

130,ggty5,CanadianInvestor,"&GT;WE KNOW ABOUT THE 15% WITHHOLDING ON GAINS IN HER TFSA BUT IS IT PER TRADE OR ON A YEARLY BASIS? FOR EXAMPLE IF SHE HAD SOME TRADES THAT WERE LOSES DO THEY COUNT AGAINST HER GAINS ON TRADES? 

THE 15% WITHHOLDING IS ONLY ON DIVIDENDS, NOT GAINS. 

&GT;FREE TRADES BUT HAS A 1.5% CURRENCY CONVERSION RATE. IS THIS A FEE LEVIED PER TRADE? FOR EXAMPLE, BOUGHT 1000 DOLLARS OF AAPL SO SHE’S LEVIED 1.5% WHEN SHE BUYS. IF SHE SELL, DOES IT CHARGE HER 1.5% AGAIN TO BE CONVERTED BACK TO CAD OR DOES IT HOLD IT IN USD IF SHE WANTED TO TRADE AGAIN SO SHE DON’T HAVE TO CONVERT BACK TO USD?

WEALTHSIMPLE ONLY ALLOWS CAD DENOMINATED ACCOUNTS, SO THE CONVERSION FEE WOULD APPLY TO BOTH BUYS AND SELLS.

&GT;OR SHE CAN HAVE DELAYED DATA AND JUST USE A DIFFERENT PLATFORM TO SEE THE BID/ASK SPREAD.

MARKET DATA IS PRETTY CHEAP AT IB, SO THAT'S AN OPTION AS WELL. NOT REALLY NECESSARY FOR INVESTING, BUT WORTHWHILE IF TRADING. NOTE THAT THE CRA DOES NOT ALLOW ACTIVE TRADING IN TFSAS, ALTHOUGH THEY GENERALLY DON'T ENFORCE THIS UNLESS YOU START MAKING SERIOUS GAINS. SOMETHING TOO KEEP IN MIND, HOWEVER. 

&GT; I’M NOT SURE HOW THE CONVERSION FEES WORKS OUT BUT WAS WONDERING WHAT THOSE ARE

IB IS BY FAR THE BEST FOR FOREIGN CONVERSION. SPOT RATE FOR A FIXED FEE OF JUST A FEW BUCKS.

&GT;G WHAT THOSE ARE. ALSO, NOTICED THERE’S A 12.50 QUARTERLY FEE FOR AN RRSP. SO 50 DOLLARS A YEAR JUST TO HAVE A RRSP WITH DELAYED DATA. 

&GT;IF SHE DOES GET INTO OPTIONS IT WOULD MAINLY BE SELLING COVERED CALLS AND PUTS.

COVERED CALLS ARE FINE, BUT PUTS CANNOT BE SOLD IN A TFSA OR AN RRSP, EVEN IF CASH-SECURED. SHE'LL NEED A NON-REGISTERED MARGIN ACCOUNT FOR THAT.",g2o2ltq,t3_ifj7m4,1598251719,1598276919.0,/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/ifj7m4/help_choosing_a_broker/g2o2ltq/

REDDIT ISN'T EXACTLY THE BEST WAY TO NAVIGATE A LARGE SUM OF MONEY AS THEY WILL GIVE YOU MANY OPINIONS. ILL LIST 3 MAIN WAYS AND A FUN 4TH WAY TO GREATLY INCREASE YOUR WEALTH. 

1. TFSA  - MAX IT TO 69K. PUT THEM INTO CDN BANKS, HIGH DIVIDEND LIKE CANADIAN RAIL ROAD, OIL AND GAS, SOME BREAK OUT TECH LSPD, SEMICONDUCTORS - SEE WWW.FINVIZ.COM CLICK ON THE HEATMAP FOR AN IDEA OF DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES. I AGREE INVESTING IT YOURSELF IS BETTER THAN PAYING SOMEONE TO DO IT. ALSO OPEN US TFSA ACCOUNT. AVOID WEALTH SIMPLE OR WEALTH TRADE BECAUSE THEY CANNOT KEEP USD CURRENCIES IN US DENOMINATION AFTER THE SALE COSTING YOU 1.5% PER TRANSACTION, WHICH IS LIKE WORSE THAN A FINANCIAL ADVISOR. 

2. RRSP - HERE YOU WILL MOST LIKELY BE ABLE TO PUT IN ANOTHER 50K OR SO. THE ADVANTAGE HERE ARE USA DIVIDENDS HAVE NO WITHOLDING TAX. SO I SUGGEST OPENING BOTH US AND CDN CURRENCY IN HERE. BUY US STOCKS THAT GIVE DIVIDENDS FOR EXAMPLE JPM, BAC, MICROSOFT, AAPL, NOW GO SLOW HERE AS MICROSOFT AND AAPL RECENTLY HAVE BLASTED OFF SO ADD IN SLOWLY. 

3. FINALLY YOU WILL HAVE MORE THAN 250K LEFT TO UTILIZE. I SUGGEST YOU OPEN BOTH US AND CDN CASH ACCOUNT. IN THE BEGINNING YOU CAN PUT SOME INTO A SAVINGS ACCOUNT UNTIL YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO BUY. YOU WILL NEED TO PAY TAXES ON YOUR INCOME WHEN YOU SELL  HERE UNFORTUNATELY SO KEEP THAT IN MIND. 

4. LEAVE 20K TO BE USED TO OPEN BANK ACCOUNTS THAT GIVE $500 PROMOTION OR MORE FOR OPENING A BANK ACCOUNT WITH THEM. LEAVE 6 ISH K IN EACH OF THEM AND THEY WAIVE A $120 CREDIT CARD EACH YEAR. DO BANK ACCOUNT/ CREDIT CARD CHURNING TO MAKE ANOTHER 20K IN POINTS VALUE EACH YEAR. YOU MAY THINK WHY DO ALL THE HASSLE DESPITE HAVING SO MUCH MONEY. THEN YOU WILL REALIZE IT'S BECAUSE YOU HAVE SO MUCH MONEY THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO CHURN BANK ACCOUNTS AND CREDIT CARDS. YOU HAVE ENTERED A NEW OPPORTUNITY ! BANK ACCOUNTS ARE AROUND 5% RETURN INVESTMENT  AND CREDIT CARDS ARE MORE THAN 10% RETURN ON SPENDING.

164,nobodynobody567,CanadianInvestor,"REDDIT ISN'T EXACTLY THE BEST WAY TO NAVIGATE A LARGE SUM OF MONEY AS THEY WILL GIVE YOU MANY OPINIONS. ILL LIST 3 MAIN WAYS AND A FUN 4TH WAY TO GREATLY INCREASE YOUR WEALTH. 

1. TFSA  - MAX IT TO 69K. PUT THEM INTO CDN BANKS, HIGH DIVIDEND LIKE CANADIAN RAIL ROAD, OIL AND GAS, SOME BREAK OUT TECH LSPD, SEMICONDUCTORS - SEE WWW.FINVIZ.COM CLICK ON THE HEATMAP FOR AN IDEA OF DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES. I AGREE INVESTING IT YOURSELF IS BETTER THAN PAYING SOMEONE TO DO IT. ALSO OPEN US TFSA ACCOUNT. AVOID WEALTH SIMPLE OR WEALTH TRADE BECAUSE THEY CANNOT KEEP USD CURRENCIES IN US DENOMINATION AFTER THE SALE COSTING YOU 1.5% PER TRANSACTION, WHICH IS LIKE WORSE THAN A FINANCIAL ADVISOR. 

2. RRSP - HERE YOU WILL MOST LIKELY BE ABLE TO PUT IN ANOTHER 50K OR SO. THE ADVANTAGE HERE ARE USA DIVIDENDS HAVE NO WITHOLDING TAX. SO I SUGGEST OPENING BOTH US AND CDN CURRENCY IN HERE. BUY US STOCKS THAT GIVE DIVIDENDS FOR EXAMPLE JPM, BAC, MICROSOFT, AAPL, NOW GO SLOW HERE AS MICROSOFT AND AAPL RECENTLY HAVE BLASTED OFF SO ADD IN SLOWLY. 

3. FINALLY YOU WILL HAVE MORE THAN 250K LEFT TO UTILIZE. I SUGGEST YOU OPEN BOTH US AND CDN CASH ACCOUNT. IN THE BEGINNING YOU CAN PUT SOME INTO A SAVINGS ACCOUNT UNTIL YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO BUY. YOU WILL NEED TO PAY TAXES ON YOUR INCOME WHEN YOU SELL  HERE UNFORTUNATELY SO KEEP THAT IN MIND. 

4. LEAVE 20K TO BE USED TO OPEN BANK ACCOUNTS THAT GIVE $500 PROMOTION OR MORE FOR OPENING A BANK ACCOUNT WITH THEM. LEAVE 6 ISH K IN EACH OF THEM AND THEY WAIVE A $120 CREDIT CARD EACH YEAR. DO BANK ACCOUNT/ CREDIT CARD CHURNING TO MAKE ANOTHER 20K IN POINTS VALUE EACH YEAR. YOU MAY THINK WHY DO ALL THE HASSLE DESPITE HAVING SO MUCH MONEY. THEN YOU WILL REALIZE IT'S BECAUSE YOU HAVE SO MUCH MONEY THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO CHURN BANK ACCOUNTS AND CREDIT CARDS. YOU HAVE ENTERED A NEW OPPORTUNITY ! BANK ACCOUNTS ARE AROUND 5% RETURN INVESTMENT  AND CREDIT CARDS ARE MORE THAN 10% RETURN ON SPENDING. 

FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME TO LET ME KNOW HOW IT GOES ! BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR MONEY. YOU HAVE ENOUGH TO RETIRE ON IF YOU KEEP WORKING.

2. CAPITAL GAINS. 

THIS IS FROM PROFITING FROM SHARE PRICE APPRECIATION. IF YOU HOLD THE SHARES IN TFSA, YOU DON’T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THIS AT ALL. IF YOU ARE NOT US TAX RESIDENTS, THEN NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. 

3. STOCK SPLITS.

THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE WITHHOLDING TAXES OR CAPITAL GAINS WHATSOEVER, ALL WHAT THIS DOES IS APPLE DECIDES TO MAKE THE CURRENT ONE SHARE AAPL INTO 4 AAPL. THIS ISN’T DIVIDEND.

KEEP IN MIND THESE ARE SOME OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL TECH COMPANIES IN THE WORLD, AND THEY ARE NOT IN HYPER GROWTH MODE. THAT PLAYS A ROLE, SO LET'S JUST SAY OUR AIM FOR SHOPIFY IS P/E 50, SOUNDS REASONABLE, RIGHT? 

10% NET PROFIT MARGIN FOR A SAAS COMPANY? THAT'S A LITTLE LOW DON'T YOU THINK? TRY 25-35% AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU GET SOMETHING MORE REALISTIC. FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU LOOK AT SHOPIFY'S ANNUAL REPORT, NOTICE A FEW THINGS:

- THEIR OPERATING CASH FLOW IS ACTUALLY POSITIVE

- MOST OF THE CASH LOST IS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITES (THAT HYPER GROWTH ISN'T FREE) 

- BASICALLY NO DEBT

SAY SHOPIFY'S REVENUE GROWS 30% ANNUALIZED FOR THE NEXT 5 YEARS. THAT'S 1.58 (2019 REVENUE) X 1.3^5 ~ 5.86B 
LET'S SAY THEIR NET PROFIT MARGIN IS 30%. THAT'S 5.86*0.3 ~ 1.758
NOW 90 / 1.758 IS 51. THAT'S OUR AIMED P/E, RIGHT? I DIDN'T EVEN USE THE MOST OPTIMISTIC NUMBERS, AND YOU CAN SURE AS HELL BET THAT SHOPIFY WILL HAVE EVEN MORE MONEY TO INVEST NOW THAT THEY ANNOUNCED THEY ARE GOING TO SWITCH TO REMOTE WORK, THOSE OFFICES AND PERKS AREN'T FREE, MEANING EVEN MORE CASH TO INVEST. 

THEY ALSO HAVE A _LOT_ OF THINGS IN THE PIPELINE, IF YOU READ THEIR ANNUAL REPORT, EVENTUALLY AS THEIR FULFILLMENT NETWORK STARTS BECOMING LARGER, THIS WILL AMPLIFY THEIR MERCHANTS EARNINGS AND CONSEQUENTLY THEIR OWN EARNING AND ATTRACT MORE BIG BUSINESSES, AS THEIR POS GROWS EVEN MORE, THEIR ONLINE STORE BECOMING A LOT BETTER, SHOPIFY AS A WHOLE IS WORTH WAY MORE THAN THE SUM OF ITS PARTS, BUT THE WAY I SEE IT, THE NUMBERS DON'T LOOK AT ALL THAT UNREALISTIC, THE QUESTION TO ASK IS, CAN THEY ACTUALLY MATERIALIZE EVERYTHING THAT'S PRICED IN AT THE MOMENT.

256,catsaysmrau,CanadianInvestor,"YOUR DEFINITION OF ""CHEAP"" IS MISGUIDED. SAY IT WITH ME: SHARE PRICE **WHEN COMPARING DIFFERENT SECURITIES** IS IRRELEVANT.

SIMPLE MATH:

100 SHARES AT $10, GOES UP BY 10%, HOW MUCH DID YOU GAIN?

10 SHARES AT $100, GOES UP BY 10%, HOW MUCH DID YOU GAIN?


COMPARING COMPANIES BASED ON SHARE PRICE IS TRULY APPLES AND ORANGES. EVERYBODY'S PIE IS CUT INTO DIFFERENT SIZED PIECES, WHILE EVERY PIE IS A DIFFERENT SIZE AND FLAVOUR. AAPL IS WORTH APPROXIMATELY $200B MORE THAN AMZN OVERALL, SO WHY ARE THEIR SHARES PRICES $314.45 AND $2383.33 RESPECTIVELY? DOES THAT MEAN AMAZON IS WORTH 6.58 TIMES WHAT APPLE IS? OF COURSE NOT.

258,catsaysmrau,CanadianInvestor,"TFSA: **TAX FREE** SAVINGS ACCOUNT. CAPITAL GAINS TAXES DO NOT APPLY, PERIOD. HOWEVER THE DOUBLE EDGE TO THAT SWORD IS THAT CAPITAL LOSSES CANNOT BE DEDUCTED. LOSS OF CONTRIBUTION ROOM IS PERMANENT, MEANING YOU CONTRIBUTE $5000 BUY A STOCK, STOCK HYPOTHETICALLY GOES TO $0 AND YOU LOSE EVERYTHING... CONTRIBUTION ROOM DOESN'T COME BACK. YEAH YOU DO GET MORE IN JANUARY, BUT THAT IS NEW ROOM, NOT A RETURN OF WHAT YOU LOST. BUT IN GENERAL IT'S TOTALLY FINE TO HOLD US STOCKS IN A TFSA, IT'S ALSO FINE TO HOLD US STOCKS THAT PAY A DIVIDEND, IT'S ONLY A SUGGESTION FOR OPTIMIZATION NOT A STEADFAST RULE. DO THE MATH WITH THE SPECIFIC HOLDINGS. HOW MUCH IS THE ANNUAL YIELD? WHAT IS 15% OF THAT? THAT'S WHAT THE US WITHHOLDS. HYPOTHETICALLY 100 SHARES OF AAPL ($31,889 USD) WOULD YIELD $328.46 ANNUALLY, 15% OF THAT IS $49.27.... THAT'S WHAT UNCLE SAM WOULD KEEP IF YOU HAD IT IN A TFSA. BUT THE EQUITY GROWTH WOULD HAVE ZERO CAPITAL GAINS TAX IF WERE TO SELL... AND LETS FACE IT, WHO IS REALLY BUYING AAPL FOR THE DIVIDEND?


BE THOUGHTFUL WITH RRSP'S BECAUSE HOW YOU USE IT GREATLY DEPENDS ON YOUR SPECIFIC PERSONAL FINANCIAL SITUATION. WHILE CAPITAL GAINS ARE NOT IMMEDIATELY TAXABLE WITHIN AN RSP, THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY AREN'T TAXED... IN A WAY. RSP CONTRIBUTIONS SHOULD BE RESERVED FOR WHEN YOU AT YOUR HIGHEST INCOME POTENTIAL, IN ORDER TO DEFER THE CORRESPONDING INCOME TAX VIA THE TAX CREDIT, AND THEN PAY THE INCOME TAX ON WITHDRAWALS ONCE YOU RETIRE AND HYPOTHETICALLY ARE IN A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER TAX BRACKET. INVESTING VIA AN RRSP WOULD ALSO LIMIT YOUR ACCESS TO THE MONEY. [BECAUSE YOU RECEIVE A TAX CREDIT WHEN YOU CONTRIBUTE, TURNING AROUND AND WITHDRAWING IS A TAXABLE EVENT.](HTTPS://WWW.CANADA.CA/EN/REVENUE-AGENCY/SERVICES/TAX/INDIVIDUALS/TOPICS/RRSPS-RELATED-PLANS/MAKING-WITHDRAWALS/TAX-RATES-ON-WITHDRAWALS.HTML) THERE ARE A FEW INSTANCES WHERE WITHDRAWALS CAN BE TAX FREE, BUT THEY HAVE THEIR OWN STIPULATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE THE [HOME BUYERS PLAN](HTTPS://WWW.CANADA.CA/EN/REVENUE-AGENCY/SERVICES/TAX/INDIVIDUALS/TOPICS/RRSPS-RELATED-PLANS/WHAT-HOME-BUYERS-PLAN.HTML) WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO TAKE OUT $35K WITH NOW TAX PENALTY, SO LONG AS YOU RE-CONTRIBUTE THAT AMOUNT WITHIN 15 YEARS. SIMILAR ONE EXISTS FOR TUITION.


IT'S TRUE THAT DIVIDENDS FROM US STOCKS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO WITHHOLDING TAX, BECAUSE THE US GOVERNMENT RECOGNIZES IT AS A PROPER REGISTERED ACCOUNT. THE TFSA HOWEVER, THEY DON'T, THAT'S WHY IT APPLIES. LIKELY BECAUSE THERE IS NO AMERICAN EQUIVALENT. BUT TO SUM UP, IF IT MAKES SENSE FOR YOU, SURE HOLD AMERICAN STOCKS IN A TFSA. IF IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR WHATEVER REASON, DON'T.

I'VE BEEN PRETTY HEAVILY RESEARCHING SINCE JANUARY, AND THE US IS THE WAY TO GO, ALTHOUGH DIVERSIFICATION IS GOOD TOO. THERE SIMPLY AREN'T MANY GOOD OPTIONS IN CANADA, RELATIVE TO THE US; THEIR ECONOMY IS MUCH MORE DIVERSIFIED AND BUSINESS FRIENDLY. THE MAIN DISADVANTAGE IS THE EXCHANGE RATE AND WITHOLDING TAXES ON AMERICAN DIVIDENDS. YOU CAN EITHER HOLD YOUR AMERICAN DIVIDEND PAYERS IN AN RRSP, TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TAX TREATY (AMERICAN DIVIDENDS ARE TAXED 15%, BUT IN THE AN RRSP ARE EXEMPT), OR YOU CAN BUY NON-DIVIDEND STOCKS, OR JUST SUCK UP THE SMALL LOSS AND HOLD THE DIVIDEND PAYERS IN YOUR TFSA.

DIVIDEND STOCKS PAY YOU OUT, WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO ASSUME TO BE, A SAFE STREAM OF INCOME EVERY QUARTER (OR MONTH). BUT THAT DIVIDEND HAS TO COME FROM SOMEWHERE. IF A STOCK IS $100/SH, AND PAYS OUT A $1 DIVIDEND, IT IS IMMEDIATELY WORTH $99 EX DIVIDEND. IF THE COMPANY ONLY HAD 1 SHARE OF $100, THEN IT IS NOW WORTH 1% LESS AS YOU'VE TAKEN THAT 1%. THE QUESTION IS NOW, DO YOU BELIEVE YOU CAN DO BETTER WITH THAT $1 THAN THE COMPANY CAN? CAN YOU REINVEST THAT $1 AND GROW IT MORE THAN THE COMPANY CAN? THE ONE THAT ALREADY HAS THE INFRASTRUCTURE, THE RESOURCES, THE SKILLS, THE KNOW-HOW, AND THE PEOPLE TO GROW THE COMPANY MORE? 

OR DO YOU SAY TO THAT COMPANY? NO, KEEP YOUR MONEY, REINVEST IT IN THE COMPANY BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN MANAGEMENT, AND GROW THAT $1 YOU WOULD HAVE GIVEN TO ME OTHERWISE INTO $1.50. NOW MY SHARES ARE WORTH MORE. ADDITIONALLY, DIVIDENDS IF THEY AREN'T IN YOUR TFSA, WILL TRIGGER TAX. CAPITAL GAINS, WHETHER OR NOT YOU SELL IT ON THE OPEN MARKET OR VIA BUYBACK, IS WHOLLY UP TO YOU WHEN YOU TAKE THAT HIT. AND CAPITAL GAINS ARE TAXED AT A LOWER RATE.

296,catsaysmrau,CanadianInvestor,"THIS SUB HAS A HARD ON FOR MINIMIZING FEES. THAT ISN'T AN INVESTMENT STRATEGY. BE AWARE OF TAX EFFICIENCY, BUT DON'T LET IT DICTATE YOUR STRATEGY.

DIVIDEND WITHHOLDING TAX SOUNDS SCARY BUT IT'S AUTOMATIC, AND HONESTLY NOT CRAZY HIGH. 15% OF DIVIDENDS ARE WITHHELD, SO FOR EXAMPLE AAPL PAYS $0.77 IN QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS RIGHT NOW, AND THAT TAX WOULD AMOUNT TO $0.462 PER SHARE PER YEAR BEING WITHHELD AND NOT PAID TO YOU. WHILE THIS IS NOT A PERFECT EXAMPLE BECAUSE BUYING AAPL ISN'T TYPICALLY FOR THE MINIMAL DIVIDEND YIELD, IT'S A TECH GROWTH STOCK FIRST AND FOREMOST.

RRSP'S ARE RECOGNIZED BY THE US AS A VALID RETIREMENT ACCOUNT, SO DUE TO OUR TAX TREATY THEY DO NOT WITHHOLD ANY PORTION OF DIVIDENDS AS TAX IF THE SECURITIES ARE HELD IN THAT KIND OF ACCOUNT. PLENTY OF PROS AND CONS FOR USING DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS TO INVEST. RRSP'S WHILE POWERFUL, THERE MAY BE SOME REASONS NOT TO USE IT FOR THIS PURPOSE AT THIS TIME IN YOUR LIFE. LIKE EVERYTHING IN INVESTING, THERE IS A GREY AREA AND IT DEPENDS ON THE SPECIFICS OF YOU AND YOUR SITUATION. FIRST CON WOULD BE ACCESS TO CAPITAL. ONCE YOU CONTRIBUTE TO THAT ACCOUNT, ANY WITHDRAWALS ARE TAXABLE INCOME. THIS IS BECAUSE YOU RECEIVE A TAX CREDIT FOR CONTRIBUTIONS. THE IDEA IS CONTRIBUTE DURING YOUR HIGHEST EARNING YEARS, AND YOU DEFER TAXES UNTIL RETIREMENT WHEN YOU'LL IN THEORY BE IN A LOWER TAX BRACKET, THUS SAVING MONEY. THE TAX SAVED DURING HIGHEST INCOME YEARS IS LIKELY MUCH MUCH GREATER THAN ANY PITTANCE OF A DIVIDEND WITHHOLDING TAX THAT WOULD APPLY OTHERWISE IF YOU ARE JUST STARTING OUT (I ASSUME YOU'RE YOUNG) AND HOLDING AMERICAN DIVIDEND PAYERS. SECOND IS THAT THERE IS A LIMIT OF CONTRIBUTION ROOM WHICH IS CALCULATED, INCREASED, AND CARRIED OVER EACH YEAR BASED ON YOUR INCOME. SO HYPOTHETICALLY IF ONE WERE TO HAVE ALREADY MAXED OUT THEIR RRSP WITH INVESTMENTS THEY WANT TO KEEP, AND THEN THEY WANT TO ALSO PURCHASE STOCK IN AN AMERICAN COMPANY THAT PAYS DIVIDENDS. SHOULD THEY NOT DO IT BECAUSE OF THE SCARY TAX? OF COURSE NOT. THIRD CON IS JUST A CON IN GENERAL ABOUT THE RRSP, NOT NECESSARILY PERTAINING TO DIVIDENDS. THERE IS NO TAX LOSS HARVESTING IN RRSP'S, OR TFSA'S FOR THAT MATTER, SO ACTIVELY TRYING TO TRADE IN AN RRSP ISN'T EXACTLY THAT SMART, IT'S MORE APPROPRIATE TO LONG LONG TERM STRATEGIES. IT IS A RETIREMENT ACCOUNT AFTER ALL.

YOU CAN DEDUCT INTEREST IN THE YEAR IT'S PAID REGARDLESS OF INCOME EARNED FROM THE SPECIFIC RELATED INVESTMENTS IN THAT SAME YEAR.

ALLOWS YOU BE TO WELL DIVERSIFIED INTO THE GLOBAL MARKET INCLUDING US AND CANADA. ALSO INCLUDES BONDS SO IN FUTURE NEAR RETIREMENT YOUR LOSSES WON'T BE AS SEVERE (IF WE ARE IN A RECESSION DURING THAT TIME).

WELL DIVERSIFIED AGAIN (GLOBALLY)  BUT WITHOUT BONDS. ONLY 100% EQUITY WHICH IS BETTER FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAVE A LONG TERM HORIZOM AND ARE NOT NEAR RETIREMENT AND DON'T NEED THE MONEY EVEN IN CASES OF RECESSION.
