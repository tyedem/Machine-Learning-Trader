BUYBACKS FAVOUR EXECUTIVES (AND OTHERS) WITH COMPENSATION PACKAGES THAT ARE TIED TO EPS OR SOME OTHER PERFORMANCE METRIC WHERE AN ACCRETIVE ACQUISITION BOOSTS THEIR COMPENSATION LEVEL WHILE AT THE SAME TIME, OTHER KEY PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL HEALTH METRICS CAN UNDERPERFORM. THEY ALSO FAVOUR SHORT TERM INVESTORS/SPECULATORS. A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS IS ICAHN'S POSITION IN AAPL BETWEEN 2013 AND 2016 AND HIS RELENTLESS PRESSURE AS AN ACTIVIST INVESTOR ON TIM COOK AND THE BOARD TO SPEND THEIR CASH ON BUYBACKS.

ANOTHER REASON NOT TO LIKE BUYBACKS IS THAT COMPANIES ARE NOTORIOUSLY BAD AT TIMING THEIR PURCHASES AND THEY DON'T NECESSARILY LEAD TO A HIGHER STOCK PRICE. IBM'S BUYBACK PROGRAM OVER THE LAST 15 YEARS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT.",den92vd,t3_5xdiya,1488938544,1488963744.0,

15,langlois44,CanadianInvestor,"I WILL START WITH MY USUAL DISCLAIMER THAT YOU SHOULDN'T ONLY CONSIDER DIVIDEND PAYING COMPANIES, THEY AREN'T MAGICAL. BUY THE STOCK OF GOOD COMPANIES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER  THEY PAY A DIVIDEND OR NOT. BERKSHIRE DOESN'T PAY A DIVIDEND, GOOGLE DOESN'T, APPLE DIDN'T FOR A LONG TIME, ETC.

THAT SAID:

ESSENTIALLY, IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT A DIVIDEND COMPANY, LOOK AT: EARNINGS/FREE CASH FLOW PER SHARE, DIVIDENDS PER SHARE, PAYOUT RATIO (DIVIDEND DIVIDED BY EPS OR FCFPS), AMOUNT OF DEBT, AND FINALLY VALUATION (SHARE PRICE DIVIDED BY EPS/FCFPS UNDER 20 IDEALLY WITH LOWER BEING BETTER). 

THERE'S A LOT MORE TO IT OBVIOUSLY, BUT THOSE ARE THE BIG ONES. I THINK THE BIG REASON DIVIDEND GROWTH INVESTING HAS BECOME POPULAR IS BECAUSE IT IS ""EASY"". BUY A COMPANY THAT GROWS ITS DIVIDEND EVERY YEAR, AND JUST MAKE SURE THAT EARNINGS ARE GOING UP AND THE PAYOUT RATIO IS LESS THAN 100%. I THINK THIS IS IGNORANT BUT TO EACH THEIR OWN. AS A START TO INVESTING YOUR OWN MONEY YOU COULD DO FAR WORSE THAN BUYING DIVIDEND GROWING COMPANIES WITH LOW PAYOUT RATIOS, BUT MAKE SURE YOU KEEP LEARNING AND TRY TO GRADUATE TO A SLIGHTLY MORE SOPHISTICATED THOUGHT PROCESS.

SPECIFICALLY REGARDING FORTIS, I AM NOT GOING TO STUDY IT TOO CLOSE, BUT IF YOU ARE GOING FOR A DIVIDEND PORTFOLIO IT IS A STAPLE. JUST BUY AND HOLD IT. IT'S POSSIBLY OVERVALUED (PROBABLY ACTUALLY) BUT IT WILL PAY ITS DIVIDEND, AND IT WILL GROW IT. SINCE THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR, IT WILL SUIT YOUR NEEDS.

THOUGH WHOLE FOODS ONLY HAS 13 STORES IN B.C.

AMAZON CURRENTLY HAS SIX FULFILLMENT CENTRES ACROSS CANADA, TWO IN VANCOUVER AND FOUR IN AND AROUND TORONTO. “ALL THREE TRADITIONAL GROCERS (LOBLAW, SOBEYS AND METRO) ARE SUFFERING FROM WHAT I CALL THE ‘APPLE’ SYNDROME,” SAID SYLVAIN CHARLEBOIS, DEAN OF MANAGEMENT AT DALHOUSIE UNIVERSITY IN HALIFAX. “IN 2001, APPLE DECIDED TO GET INTO MUSIC, AN INDUSTRY THAT IT WASN’T IN, AND NOW THEY DOMINATE SALES IN THAT INDUSTRY BRILLIANTLY,” HE SAID. “AMAZON IS MAKING A STATEMENT TODAY.

THEY ARE NOT DEVELOPERS ANYMORE BUT PUBLISHERS WHO OWN/MANAGE DEVELOPERS. I.E. TAKETWO OWNS ROCKSTAR (MAKES OF GTA) AND 2K (MAKERS OF SPORT GAMES). IF A COMPANY IS SUCCESSFUL, THEY TEND TO PURCHASE THEM AND/OR WORK WITH THEM. FOR EXAMPLE ACTIVISION IS GOING HARD AFTER THE MOBILE INDUSTRY WITH A GAME CALLED HEARTSTONE. ANOTHER COMPANY I DIDN'T EVEN MENTION... YOU MUST HAVE HEARD OF POKEMON GO, RIGHT? IT WAS ALL THE RAGE NOT TOO LONG AGO. THAT WAS NINTENDO BY THE WAY TACKLING THE MOBILE INDUSTRY. 

AND FOR THE RECORD THIS IDEA OF CONSTANTLY CHANGING WITH TIME IS BECOMING MORE AND MORE PREVALENT IN THE TECH INDUSTRY. I.E. LOOK AT FACEBOOK, IT USED TO BE JUST A SINGLE SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORM. THEY NOW OWN A VR COMPANY, INSTAGRAM &AMP; WHATSAPP. EVEN AS FACEBOOK'S HYPE IS FADING AMONG MILLENNIALS THEY STILL OWN THE MARKET WITH INSTAGRAM AND WHATSAPP. THEN YOU HAVE MICROSOFT WHO NOW OWNS LINKEDIN, MAKE THEIR OWN COMPUTER LINES (SURFACE), THEY WENT OUT TO EVEN MAKE A CONSOLE 12 YEARS AGO. APPLE &AMP; GOOGLE ARE NOW MAKING CARS. TESLA WHICH WAS A CAR COMPANY IS NOW MAKING SOLAR PANELS. THE TECH INDUSTRY AFTER THE DOTCOM CRASH KNOWS WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU DONT EVOLVE WITH THE TIME (YOU FADE OUT LIKE MYSPACE).

ANYWAYS AS FOR CHIPS? DEPENDS, DO YOU MEAN GRAPHICS OR PROCESSOR? 

- **$NVDA:** HELL YEAH (THOUGHT I AM NOT IN IT AT THE MOMENT). NVIDIA IS JUST... UTTERLY DOMINATING THE GRAPHIC CHIP INDUSTRY. REMEBER I MENTIONED COMPANIES EVOLVING WITH THE TIME? NEW CARS ARE STARTING TO HAVE COMPUTERIZED DASHBOARDS (LITERALLY A COMPUTER). COMPANIES WILL GO TO NVDA FOR THE GRAPHIC CARDS FOR THESE COMPUTERS (AS TESLA ALREADY IS). SO YOU CAN NOT GO WRONG WITH THEM.

- **$INTL:** THEY ARE A OK, I AM NOT THAT INTERESTED.... JUST RECENTLY THEY DIDN'T HAVE GOOD REACTIONS TOWARDS THEIR I9 CHIP SERIES (WATCH A VIDEO FROM LINUS WHO BREAKS IT DOWN). 

- **$AMD:** ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE HAVING A ROCKY START OF A YEAR (GOLDMAN SACS LOWERING ITS VALUE WITH A SIMPLE ARTICLE, NEW PRODUCTS JUST RELEASING, EARNINGS COMING OUT BELOW AVERAGE). THERE IS A LOT OF HOPE AROUND THEIR PROCESSOR CHIPS. AMD HAS HAD A TROUBLE PAST BUT SINCE LAST YEAR WITH A NEW CEO THEY HAVE BEEN ON A TEAR IF YOU LOOK AT IT FROM A YEAR END PERCEPTIVE. PEOPLE ARE EXPECTING Q3 TO BE THE CATALYST FOR THEM. AND THIS NEW BAD PRESS FOR INTEL'S I9 IS ACTUALLY WORKING IN AMD'S FAVOR.

APPLE - BOUGHT FOR $89 (POST SPLIT) 4 OR 5 YEARS AGO, NOW $144.12

THE STOCK WOULD HAVE TO FALL 87% BEFORE MY ORIGINAL COST IS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED.

ONE OTHER POINT - IN ALL CASES THE DIVIDENDS HAVE RISEN MEANING THE RETURN ON MY ORIGINAL INVESTMENT COST BASE IS INCREMENTALLY HIGHER.
