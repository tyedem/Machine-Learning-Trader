1,gwelfguy,CanadianInvestor,"I'M NOT A BIG BELIEVER IN BUYING INDIVIDUAL STOCKS MYSELF, UNLESS SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS AN EXCEPTIONAL INVESTMENT COMES ALONG.

THE FACTORS THAT AFFECT A STOCK'S PRICE ARE THE OVERALL MARKET, WHICH TENDS TO RISE AND FALL IN UNISON, THE INDUSTRY TO WHICH THE COMPANY BELONGS, WHICH ALSO TENDS TO RISE AND FALL IN UNISON, AND FINALLY THE COMPANY ITSELF AND PARAMETERS LIKE ITS FINANCIAL METRICS, COMPETITIVE POSITION, UNIQUE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, ETC.  THE POINT IS THAT YOU CAN GET &GT;80% OF THE GAINS THAT ARE ACCESSIBLE TO YOU JUST BY INVESTING IN INDEX AND THEMATIC FUNDS.  WHEN YOU INVEST IN INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES, THE WORKLOAD IN RESEARCHING THOSE COMPANIES, TIMING YOUR BUY AND SELL ACTIONS, ETC. SKYROCKETS, AND THE GAINS ARE ONLY INCREMENTAL.

ANOTHER WAY OF LOOKING AT IS IS THAT THERE MIGHT BE A STOCK THAT YOU THINK IS THE NEXT TSLA, BUT YOU'RE NOT SURE.  SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO THROW THE ENTIRE VALUE OF YOUR PORTFOLIO AT THAT STOCK.  BY THE TIME YOU HEDGE YOUR PORTFOLIO WITH INCOME INVESTMENTS, OTHER COMPANIES THAT YOU THINK WILL DO WELL, ETC. YOUR OVERALL PORT WILL PROBABLY JUST RETURN NOMINAL GAINS.

* WOULD I BE UNABLE TO DO BULL-SPREADS, SINCE I CAN'T SELL/WRITE OPTIONS I DON'T OWN?
* LET'S SAY I OWN A BULL LONG CALL AT STRIKE 32 THAT EXPIRES IN A YEAR. I WOULD STILL BE ABLE TO SELL THIS OPTION TO MARKET EARLY BY SELLING/WRITING A STRIKE 32 CALL? 
* USING THE EXAMPLE ABOVE, I WOULD BE UNABLE TO EXERCISE THE OPTION TO RECEIVE THE 100 STOCKS IN EXCHANGE FOR THE OPTION - UNLESS I HAVE THE FUNDS TO ACTUALLY PURCHASE 100 X $32 STOCKS?
* IF I LET A LONG CALL EXPIRE ITM, AND DON'T HAVE THE FUNDS TO EXERCISE THE OPTION, WOULD THE OPTION-CALL AUTOMATICALLY BE SOLD TO THE MARKET AT MARKET-VALUE?

SO FIRST OF ALL, THINGS I AGREE WITH YOU OR SIMILAR: 
1. S AND P ETF IS NICE BUT THERE MAYBE BETTER STRATEGIES
2. I ALSO BOUGHT HIGH DIV ETFS LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS! I BOUGHT SRU.UN, REI.UN, ENB MY TOP HOLDINGS, ALONG WITH TONS OF OTHER GAS LIKE SU AT $20 ! JUST WISH I BOUGHT MORE. I SOLD TD TOO EARLY AT $66 BUT I GOT IN AT $58 SO HEY I HAVE THINGS TO WORK ON. I GOT AC TOO ! UP 16% WOOHOO!
3. IN TERMS OF ARK, I ALSO AGREE THAT 90% OF THAT FUND IS DONE. LIKE YOU SAID MOST OF THE WINNERS HAVE MATURED AND THEY WON'T BE FULL OF SMALLER CAP COMPANIES. THAT SAID I AM FOLLOWING THE CHANGES IN THAT FUND IN PARTICULAR THEY ARE BUYING PALINTIR. YOU CAN GOOGLE LUCID TRACKING FOR THAT INFO. 

IN TERMS OF THE MANY ETFS YOU ARE INTO, I'M NOT AS FAMILIAR ALTHOUGH I DID BUY VANGUARD PREFERRED SHARES ETF, AND ISHARES CAPPED REITS PURELY BECAUSE I STUMBLED UPON THEM AND THEY HAVE HIGH DIV. SO I'M NOT COMPLETELY AGAINST A WELL DIVERSIFIED ETF STRATEGY. 

MORE SO MY POINT IS S AND P 500 HAS 50% CRAP MEANING THINGS I NORMALLY WOULD NOT BUY BUT IT GOT PACKAGED INTO IT. ALSO THE PENDING BOMB WHEN THE S AND P, 11- 15 TRILLION DOLLARS FUNDS MUST BUY TESLA, SHORT TERM TESLA GOES UP, BUT COME JANUARY I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN. I PREFER BE OUTSIDE E.G. NOT S AND P STOCKS BECAUSE WHEN IT HAPPENS SINCE TESLA WILL EAT 3-5% OF IT. OR IN OTHER WORDS ALL THE 499 COMPANIES WILL BE GETTING SOLD IN THE SIZE OF 3-5% OF THEIR MARKETCAPS.

141,jz187,CanadianInvestor,"TAKE MY WORDS WITH A GRAIN OF SALT BECAUSE I SHORTED NIO AT $6. (DON'T WORRY, I'M NOT HOMELESS BECAUSE I COVERED AT $7)

I USED TO BE A MAJOR BEAR ON NIO, I THOUGHT IT WAS EVEN MORE OF A FRAUD THAN TSLA. TESLA AT LEAST MANUFACTURE CARS, NIO IS BASICALLY A POWERPOINT MANUFACTURER.

THAT BEING SAID, I HAD AN EPIPHANY RECENTLY ON NIO'S BUSINESS MODEL. NOW I'M NOT SAYING THAT THEY ARE A GREAT BUSINESS OR ANYTHING, BUT NOW I HAVE REALIZED THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE A FRAUD AFTER ALL. I JUST DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THEIR BUSINESS MODEL BEFORE.

THE BEST METAPHOR I CAN THINK OF TO DESCRIBE NIO IS IMAGINE AN AIRLINE THAT DIDN'T FLY AIRPLANES. IMAGINE IF AN AIRLINE OUTSOURCED THE FLYING OF PASSENGERS AND JUST KEPT THE FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAM. FREQUENT FLYER PROGRAMS ARE OFTEN THE MOST FINANCIALLY VALUABLE PIECE OF AN AIRLINES. IT'S CAPITAL LIGHT, HAS HIGH PROFIT MARGINS, AND CREATES CUSTOMER LOYALTY.

NIO IS BASICALLY THAT FOR THE CAR INDUSTRY. THEIR MOST VALUABLE ASSET IS THEIR BRAND. THEY PUT ALL THEIR FOCUS ON CREATING A GREAT CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE. THEY HAVE THESE FANCY NIO HOUSES IN MAJOR CHINESE CITIES THAT ARE BASICALLY LUXURY LOUNGES FOR NIO OWNERS. THEY HOST SOCIAL EVENTS FOR NIO OWNERS. THEY ARE BASICALLY CREATING AN EXCLUSIVE SOCIAL CLUB FOR UPPER MIDDLE CLASS PEOPLE THAT REVOLVE AROUND THEIR CARS.

TO UNDERSTAND NIO'S BUSINESS MODEL, YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND SOCIAL DYNAMICS. NIO HAS POSITIONED ITSELF AS AN OBJECT OF ATTAINABLE ASPIRATION. IT IS JUST BEYOND AFFORDABLE FOR THE AVERAGE CHINESE MIDDLE CLASS, BUT ATTAINABLE WITH SOME EFFORT. IT IS BASICALLY THE BRAND OF YOUR SUCCESSFUL CLASSMATE. THIS BRAND POSITIONING HAS INCREDIBLE POWER IN AN UPWARDLY MOBILE SOCIETY LIKE CHINA.

THERE ARE 2 THINGS THAT SELL CARS: VALUE AND STATUS. IF YOU COMPETE ON VALUE, YOU ARE COMPETING WITH EVS LIKE THE $4000 WULING MINI EV. NEITHER TESLA NOR NIO CAN COMPETE IN THAT MARKET. WULING IS THE MASTER OF VALUE CARS IN CHINA. IF YOU COMPETE ON STATUS, THEN YOU NEED TO CREATE SOCIAL VALUE FOR YOUR CUSTOMERS. YOUR CUSTOMERS ARE NOT BUYING TECH OR CAR, BUT CACHET. THIS IS THE PART THAT NIO REALLY EXCEL AT.

WHEN YOU BUY A TESLA, YOUR FRIENDS WILL MAKE FUN OF YOU EVERY TIME A TESLA CAR SELF-DRIVES INTO A FIXED OBJECT OR SELF IMMOLATES AND THIS GOES VIRAL ON SOCIAL MEDIA. TESLA SELLS TECH, SO THE SOCIAL VALUE OF A TESLA FALLS EVERY TIME A TESLA DOES SOMETHING EMBARRASSING IN PUBLIC. NIO SELLS STATUS, SO IT FOCUSES ON CREATING SOCIAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR ITS OWNERS TO ASSOCIATE THEMSELVES WITH COOL AND SUCCESS. THIS IS A VERY DIFFERENT VALUE PROPOSITION FROM A CONVENTIONAL CAR MAKER.

ONCE AGAIN, I'M NOT SURE IF THIS WILL BE A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS MODEL, BUT NIO SHOULD NOT BE THOUGHT OF AS A CAR COMPANY. TAKE THIS FROM A FORMER BEAR.",ga4hhgj,t3_jhz7t3,1603675491,1603700691.0,/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/jhz7t3/nio_a_buy_at_this_very_moment_or_wait_and_watch/ga4hhgj/

I MIGHT SET A STOP AT 340.00, OR IF I AM VERY CONFIDENT IN THE STOCK RECOVERING, AT 280.00.  SETTING IT TOO HIGH AT 360.00 MIGHT STOP YOU OUT JUST BEFORE IT BOUNCES OFF OF THAT SUPPORT LEVEL.

ONCE THE STOCK CLEARLY ESTABLISHES A HIGHER SUPPORT, MOVE THE STOP UP ONE LEVEL.  WITH LONG-TERM STOCKS IT'S MAINLY THERE TO PROTECT YOU FROM **VERY BAD THING**, NOT NORMAL MARKET FLUCTUATIONS.  IF SUPPORT LEVELS ARE TOO FAR BELOW CURRENT PRICE FOR YOU TO ABSORB THOSE LOSSES, IT'S NOT A GOOD TIME TO ENTER - EITHER WAIT FOR A DIP OR NEW HIGHER SUPPORT.

""I WANT MORE EXPOSURE TO BIOTECHS THAN ARKK PROVIDES BUT ARKK AND ARKG HAVE ABOUT 40% OVERLAP. ARKG AND ARKW HAVE A 4% OVERLAP. OVERALL 5% OF MY EXPOSURE IS TO TSLA HOLDING G AND W, AS OPPOSED TO 10% WITH ARKK ALONE. I KIND OF PREFER IT THAT WAY SINCE IT'S ALL A GAMBLE ANYWAYS.""

THANK YOU FOR THE QUICK ANSWER !

FOR THE ONLY FEW STOCKS I SELECT, I TRY TO FOLLOW MY RULES NOT TO INVEST ON SOMETHING I DON'T FULLY UNDERSTAND &AMP; TRUST DEEPLY.

EX : I PREFER TO INVEST IN HUBS THAN IN CRM BECAUSE I TRULY BELIEVE HUBSPOT TO HAVE A BETTER PRODUCT &AMP; STRATEGY THAN SALESFORCE

I'M NOT SURE I LIKE PAYPAL

I LIKE TSLA AND HAVE SOME WITH  ARKK, BUT NOT ENOUGH TO TRY TO BUY THIS SINGLE STOCK

I KNOW NOTHING GO TSM AND BABA

I THINK IF YOU AVERAGE IN AROUND 20 BUCKS A SHARE YOU'RE GONNA SEE A POSITIVE RETURN, LOOK AT SUNCOR'S PLATFORM, THEY ARE BIG IN RENEWABLE ENERGY AND OIL UPGRADING TECHNOLOGY. ONCE COVID RECOVERY IS IN PLACE THE DEMAND FOR ENERGY WILL RETURN AND THEIR SHARE PRICE WILL INCREASE. ITS NOT LIKE EVERYONE AND EVERY COMPANY CAN SWITCH TO ELECTRIC OVERNIGHT, LET ALONE, THE SUPPLY ISN'T THERE. CURRENTLY THEY ARE RECOVERING FROM FIRE DAMAGE IN ONE PLANT AS WELL, THE SHARE PRICE WILL DECLINE WHEN YOUR PRODUCT PRODUCTION IS STYMIED AND DEMAND IS LOW, IT'S ENERGY.

SUNCOR IS AN ESTABLISHED BLUE-CHIP COMPANY AND IT WOULD BE FOOLISH NOT TO INCLUDE A CHUNK OF IT IN YOUR PORTFOLIO AT BELOW 20 BUCKS PER SHARE. I KNOW I'M IN AND I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO MAKE 50%, AT LEAST, IN WHAT TODAY EVEN SMOOTH BRAIN INVESTOR WOULD BUY.

THE INVESTMENT THE GOVERNMENTS HAVE PUT IN ISN'T GOING WAYSIDE EITHER, LETS FACE IT THEY HAVE A DUTY TO SUPPORT WESTERN CANADIAN OIL AS THEY DO THE ATLANTIC FISHERIES AND QUEBEC/ONTARIO MANUFACTURING. ITS ACTUALLY QUITE FUNNY TO SEE PEOPLE RATIONALIZE HOW BAD SUNCOR IS. THIS IS THE CHEAPEST PROFIT ONE CAN BUY!

THEY ONLY HAVE 185M SHARES OUTSTANDING AND CONSIDERING HOW MANY SHARES ARE HELD BY THE EXECUTIVES AND ELON MUSK, THERE'S NOT A LOT OF SHARES TO GO AROUND.

I DON'T CARE IF TSLA GOES TO ZERO ONE DAY (WHICH I DON'T THINK IT WILL BUT KEEP READING), BY HAVING MY 1 SHARE I FEEL LIKE I'M PART OF A COMPANY THAT MIGHT CHANGE THE WORLD.

AND BY THOSE STANDARDS, AND AT THESE PRICES I WOULD NEED TO SEE TSLA EARNING 40B IN PROFIT IN THE NEAR FUTURE.

YES, THERE'S A LOT OF GROWTH EXPECTATIONS BAKED INTO TSLA AND AMZN'S STOCK PRICES. WITH AMZN IT'S EASY TO SEE A REASONABLE CASE FOR THOSE EXPECTATIONS, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT AMZN REALLY ISN'T ABOUT TURNING A PROFIT; THEY RE-INVEST AND GROW.

THAT SAID, IF YOU PICK UP A DIVERSIFIED ETF YOU CAN EXPECT BETWEEN 4% AND 9% RETURN PER YEAR ON THE MONEY YOU INVEST.  SOME YEARS YOU'LL HAVE A -10% RETURN, SOME YEARS YOU'LL HAVE A +30% RETURN, BUT ON AVERAGE, OVER THE LONG HAUL, YOU'LL GET AROUND 6 OR 7.

&GT; GETTING INTO THIS FIELD AS A SIDE HUSTLE

**NO.  JUST NO.**  YOU AREN'T SMART ENOUGH FOR THIS.  WHAT YOU'RE INSINUATING IS DAY TRADING, AND YOU'LL LOSE.  WHAT YOU CAN DO IS PARK YOUR MONEY IN REGULAR INSTALLMENTS IN SOMETHING CALLED VGRO.  YOU WONT CHANGE YOUR LIFE WITH THE MARKET, BUT YOU'LL ENSURE YOU'RE NOT DESTITUTE WHEN YOU RETIRE (AND YOU MIGHT BE ABLE TO RETIRE EARLIER THAN OTHERS).

RESIST THE DESIRE TO 'PLAY.'  YOU'LL SEE OTHER PEOPLE HERE SAYING HOW THEY MADE SO MUCH ON A QUICK TRADE ON SHOP OR TSLA... IGNORE THE FOMO (FEAR OF MISSING OUT).  PUT YOUR MONEY INTO A WELL DIVERSIFIED ETF LIKE VGRO AND JUST WAIT IT OUT.

==HOW TO START==

OPEN UP A QUESTRADE ACCOUNT.  YOU CAN CHOOSE MARGIN, TFSA OR RRSP.  MARGIN SHOULD BE THE LAST ACCOUNT YOU USE TO INVEST AS IT'S NOT TAX SHELTERED.  RRSP OR TFSA DEPENDS ON JUST EXACTLY HOW MUCH YOU EARN A YEAR, BUT WE'RE TALKING PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR DIFFERENCES FOR MOST PEOPLE.  RRSPS AND TFSAS HAVE MAXIMUM CONTRIBUTION ALLOWANCES (YOU CAN FIND OUT WHAT YOUR CONTRIBUTION IS FROM YOUR TAX RETURN), SO PUT ALL YOUR MONEY INTO THEM BEFORE MOVING ON TO MARGIN.  TFSA HAS ONE BENEFIT OVER RRSP IN THAT YOU CAN WITHDRAW YOUR MONEY AT ANY TIME WITHOUT PENALTY.  YOU CAN WRITE OFF YOUR RRSP CONTRIBUTION, BUT IF YOU WITHDRAW THE MONEY YOU'LL FACE A WITHHOLDING FEE AND TAXES.

ONCE YOUR ACCOUNT IS SETUP, YOU CAN EASILY MAKE ""BILL PAYMENTS"" FROM YOUR ONLINE BANK TO YOUR QUESTRADE ACCOUNTS.  QUESTRADE HAS EASY TO FOLLOW INSTRUCTIONS, AND IF YOU'RE SCARED, THEY HAVE GOOD CUSTOMER SUPPORT TO HELP YOU OUT.  IT'S AS EASY AS PAYING YOUR WATER BILL ONLINE.

ONCE THE MONEY IS TRANSFERED INTO THE ACCOUNT, YOU THEN ""BUY"" THE ETF.  QUESTRADE HAS NO FEES FOR BUYING ETFS, BUT THEY DO HAVE A FEE IF YOU SELL THEM.

WITH THAT BEING SAID, I'VE SEEN A TON OF LARGE CAP DIVIDEND-PAYING COMPANIES COME OUT STRONG OUT OF RECESSIONS WHILE CONTINUOUSLY GROWING THEIR DIVIDENDS. DIVIDENDS ACT AS AN INCENTIVE TO HOLD ONTO A HOLDING; YOU'RE BEING REWARDED FOR INVESTING IN A COMPANY. DIVIDENDS ARE ALSO GOOD TO HEDGE AGAINST LOSSES IN SOME SCENARIOS. FINALLY, **CANADIAN** DIVIDENDS ARE TAXED THE SAME AS CAPITAL GAINS OUTSIDE OF A REGISTERED ACCOUNT: 50% OF YOUR TAX BRACKET. 

GROWTH STOCKS ARE EXCELLENT IF YOU BELIEVE THAT IF A COMPANY HOLDS ONTO THEIR PROFIT THEY CAN USE IT TO BECOME MORE PROFITABLE, PAY DEBT, AND DO OTHER THINGS THAT WILL INCREASE ITS HEALTH AND LONGEVITY. GROWTH-ORIENTED COMPANIES ARE ALSO NOTORIOUS FOR GOING FROM SMALL TO MID TO LARGE CAP IN A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME (SHOP, TSLA). 

EVEN THOUGH DIVIDENDS GET TAXED MORE FAVOURABLY THAN INTEREST ON A BOND, THEY STILL GET TAXED. IN YOUR CASE, YOU'RE USING A TFSA SO AS LONG AS THEY'RE **CANADIAN** STOCKS YOU SHOULD BE FINE.

BUT NOT BECAUSE OF THE HYPE.

BECAUSE OF THE TECH.  THEY'RE THE WORLD'S LEADER IN BATTERY PRODUCTION FOR VEHICLES, SO EVEN IF THEIR VEHICLES AREN'T THE MOST POPULAR FOR SOME REASON, THEY STILL DOMINATE THE MARKET BY OTHER MEANS.

THEY ALSO HAVE DIRECT ACCESS TO A HUGE FRACTION OF THE WORLD'S LITHIUM SUPPLY BY THE NATURE OF DEVELOPING THEIR OWN BATTERIES WITH UNIQUE RECYCLING TECH THAT ALLOWS THEM TO RECOVER 95% OF LITHIUM EASILY AND WITH AN ALREADY ESTABLISHED PROCESS (NO OTHER BATTERY TECH HAS THAT).

THEY'RE AN INDUSTRY LEADER BY SEVERAL YEARS IN AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES.  THEY HAVE A MULTI-YEAR HEAD START IN THIS THAT FEW ARE LIKELY TO MATCH.   THEY'RE ALSO WELL ESTABLISHED IN INDUSTRIAL POWER, RESIDENTIAL POWER AND HAVE A LOT OF OTHER AVENUES FOR POSSIBLE GROWTH.

NOT TO MENTION SPACE EXPLORATION, WHICH ALTHOUGH IT SOUNDS CRAZY, THEIR CURRENT VEHICLES (CYBERTRUCK) ARE BEING DESIGNED FOR EXTRAPLANETARY VACUUM OPERATION (SERIOUSLY) WITH RELATIVELY FEW MODIFICATIONS.  WITH SPACEX STARSHIP LIKELY TO MAKE A TRIP TO THE MOON IN THE NEXT 12-16 MONTHS AND MARS IN THE NEXT 2-5 YEARS, THAT'S A REAL THING.

SO I USUALLY ADVISE YOUNGER PEOPLE TO NOT LOOK OUT FOR DIVIDEND PAYING STOCKS. OLDER PEOPLE LIKE THIS BECAUSE THE DIVIDENDS IS WHAT THEY CAN TAKE OUT TO PAY FOR THEIR DAILY EXPENSES WHEN THEY RETIRE.

ADDITIONALLY, DIVIDEND PAYING STOCKS, WHILE THERE ARE SOME THAT WILL PERFORM WELL IN TERMS OF GROWTH PLUS DIVIDEND, THE COMPANIES THAT ARE TRULY THE GROWTH COMPANIES WILL OUTGROW THEM BY FOLDS. 

30-50% GAINS IS TOO SMALL FOR ME AS BUFFER FOR PICKING YOUR OWN STOCKS IF YOU HAVE HELD THEM FOR YEARS. THE REASON BEING IS THIS, LETS SAY 50% OF YOUR STOCKS THAT YOU PICK BUST AND THE OTHER 50% DOES WELL. THE WINNING 50% THAT MEANS HAS TO COVER THE LOSSES OF THE LOSING 50% AND THEN SOME ADDITIONAL AMOUNT SO THAT THE OVERALL % BEATS THE S&AMP;P500 ETF. IF YOU ARE NOT MATCHING YOURSELF AGAINST THE BENCHMARK AND BEATING IT, YOU SHOULD JUST INVEST IN THE BENCHMARK ITSELF.


IN TERMS OF VALUATION, YOU CAN USE DIFFERENT VALUATION METRICS TO VALUE A COMPANY. YOU CAN TRY SIMILAR COMPANIES LIKE IT AND VALUE IT AS WELL. EXPAND YOUR COMPARISONS TO OTHER COMPANIES THAT MIGHT NOT BE USED IN COMPARISON TRADITIONALLY ESPECIALLY ONES THAT ARE CONSIDERED DISRUPTORS. I WOULD NEVER VALUE TSLA USING AUTOMAKERS VALUATION. THIS IS BECAUSE AN AUTOMAKER IS AN ORGANIZATION THAT HAS A LOT OF CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN OLD TECHNOLOGIES THAT EVENTUALLY NEEDS TO BE WRITTEN OFF. FURTHER, THEY ALSO HAVE THE BAGGAGE OF UNIONS AND PENSIONS.

SECOND, THESE COMPANIES HAVE RUN UP A LOT IN THE PAST YEAR AND THEIR FUNDAMENTALS DON’T NECESSARILY SUPPORT THE PRICE, SO YOU MAY ALSO BE BUYING AT AN UNSUSTAINABLE HIGH, WHICH INCREASES YOUR RISK OF LOSS.

770,A_Megaton_Of_Freedom,CanadianInvestor,"YOU'RE DOING GREAT IF YOU'VE MAXED OUT YOUR TFSA AT YOUR AGE.

I'D ADVISE TO CCP* IT UNTIL YOU KNOW MUCH MORE ABOUT FINANCE AND SUCH, BUT THE BEST WAY TO LEARN IS TO ACTUALLY HAVE AT IT. SO YOU MIGHT WANT TO EXPERIMENT AND LEARN ALONG THE WAY, WITH THE FUNDS THAT AREN'T IN A REGISTERED ACCOUNT. 

THE BENEFIT IS THAT IF YOU MAKE LOSSES ON A GIVEN YEAR, YOU CAN USE THOSE LOSSES TO REDUCE THE TAX BURDEN IN FUTURE YEARS. (IN A REGISTERED ACCOUNT, YOU WOULDN'T PAY TAXES ANYWAY, SO LOSSES ARE JUST VERY BAD, AND DO NOT ALLOW YOU TO CONTRIBUTE MORE)

ADDITIONAL PIECE OF ADVICE FOR STOCKS: BUY LOW SELL HIGH IS BULLSHIT.   SO IS BUY THE DIP. YOU DON'T BUY THE DIP, YOU BUY THE UNDERVALUED AND SELL THE OVER-VALUED. THE PRACTICAL RESULT IS THAT EVEN IF YOU PAY 100$ FOR A STOCK, IF IT DROPS TO 90$, YOU SHOULDN'T WAIT FOR IT TO GET ""HIGH"" BACK TO 100$ TO BREAK EVEN. THAT'S THE SUNKEN COST FALLACY.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO IS EVALUATE WHETHER THE PRICE IT IS AT RIGHT NOW IS APPROPRIATE, OR ABOVE/BELOW WHAT IT SHOULD BE. THAT REQUIRES A LOT OF READING, WHICH MOST PEOPLE DO NOT CONSISTENTLY HAVE TIME FOR. 

AS FOR BUYING THE DIP, YOU MAY DO THAT IF IT EQUATES TO BUYING A STOCK YOU HAD BEEN WATCHING AND NOW KNOW IS UNDERVALUED. EX: I BOUGHT TSLA WENT IT DOWN AFTER WE'D SEEN ELON MUSK SMOKE POT ON JRE. THAT WAS A GOOD DECISION BECAUSE I KNEW THE COMPANY AND KNEW SELLING SHARES ON THE BASIS OF THE CEO SMOKING POT WAS BULLSHIT.

I ALSO BOUGHT BA AFTER THE SECOND 737 MAX CRASH. THAT WAS A TERRIBLE DECISION BECAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW HOW SHITTY BOEING'S CORPORATE CULTURE WAS. 

NOW OF COURSE THE GOAL IS TO BUY LOW SELL HIGH, BUT THAT'S LIKE TELLING A FOOTBALL PLAYER TO LAND MORE TOUCHDOWNS. ""YEAH THANKS MATE, HADN'T CONSIDERED THAT BEFORE /S"".


OH AND, OPTIONS ARE ENTICING BUT DON'T FORGET THAT OPTIONS BUYERS ARE WRONG 75% OF THE TIME. BUT I'M GETTING IN THE WEEDS HERE...

AND DON'T PUT MONEY IN STOCKS IF YOU MIGHT NEED IT IN LESS THAN TWO YEARS. THAT'S ABOUT HOW LONG IT TAKES FOR THE MARKET TO REBOUND DURING A RECESSION. (IF YOU HAVE COLLEGE COMING UP, AND BUDGET 30K$/YEAR, THEN MAKE SURE THAT 30K-60K (DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH YOU EXPECT TO EARN FOR THOSE TWO YEARS) IS WITHIN REACH. ONCE THAT'S DONE, ANY EXCESS FUNDS YOU CAN DO WHATEVER WITH.

EVERYTHING I'VE SAID CONSISTS OF GENERALITIES AND MAY NOT BE RIGHT FOR YOU. OR I MAY BE COMPLETELY WRONG BECAUSE I'M AN UNQUALIFIED 22 YEAR OLD.
