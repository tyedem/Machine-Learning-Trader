USE NORBERT TO CONVERT YOUR $ (CAN ALSO BE DONE USING DLR AND DLR.U - ASK QUESTRADE FOR DETAILS) AND MAYBE WAIT FOR A PRICE PULL BACK AND/OR MORE FAVOURABLE FX SO YA CAN MAYBE AT LEAST GET 4 SHARES

CONSIDER PUTTING THE REST OF YOUR $ OVER AND ABOVE THE AMZN PURCHASE INTO A US-LISTED ETF LIKE VT (WORLD EQUITY) OR SIMILAR CAD-LISTED ONE LIKE XAW TO HELP MAINTAIN THE MIN ACCOUNT BALANCES, OR ELSE JUST PLUNK IT IN PSA (A HIGH INTEREST SAVINGS ETF) OR AN HISA MUTUAL FUND

16,Natural11,CanadianInvestor,"I ASSUME YOU'RE ASKING THIS QUESTION BECAUSE YOU HAVE AN EXTRA 6K AND WANT TO DO SOMETHING BOLD THAT COULD MULTIPLY YOUR INVESTMENT.

THE BEST ADVICE I CAN OFFER YOU FROM EXPERIENCE IS TO STAY AWAY FROM PENNY STOCKS ALTOGETHER. MOST OF MY LOSSES WHEN I STARTED TRADING CAME FROM PENNY STOCKS, BECAUSE I CHOSE TO FOCUS ON THE SUCCESS STORIES INSTEAD OF THE FAILURES. FOR EVERY ONE THAT SUCCEEDS, NINE FAIL. I'M PROBABLY BEING GENEROUS WITH THAT RATIO.

PENNY STOCKS ARE CHEAP FOR A REASON. THEY'RE TYPICALLY OPERATING IN THE RED AND THEIR SHARE PRICES ARE ON A STEADY SLOPE DOWNWARD. BECAUSE THEY CANNOT SUSTAIN THEIR BUSINESS THROUGH REVENUE, THEY SELL MORE SHARES TO SUPPLEMENT THEIR INCOME WHICH DILUTES THEIR SHARE FLOAT AND THE VALUE OF YOUR SHARES. BRING UP THE 5 YEAR CHART ON GEVO OR DRYS AND YOU'LL GET THE IDEA.

IT'S STILL POSSIBLE TO MULTIPLY YOUR INVESTMENT BY INVESTING IN GOOD COMPANIES. CHECK OUT SHOP FOR A PRETTY GOOD CANADIAN EXAMPLE.

IF YOU NEED THAT THRILL OF AN ALL OR NOTHING APPROACH AND WANT SOME LEVERAGE IN YOUR LIFE, YOU CAN LEARN OPTIONS TRADING. I RECOMMEND THIS ONLY AFTER YOU'VE BECOME AN EXPERIENCED TRADER. LIKE PENNY STOCKS, OPTIONS CAN BE A GOOD WAY TO WIPE OUT YOUR ACCOUNT, BUT THEY CAN OFFER LEVERAGED UPSIDE AND THE FREEDOM TO TRADE COMPANIES LIKE AMZN AND GOOGL WHICH ARE OTHERWISE EXPENSIVE TO HOLD SHARES OF.
