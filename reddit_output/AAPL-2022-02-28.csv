0,Sunsmiling,CanadianInvestor,"MAYBE I CAN SHARE MY EXPERIENCE.  
WHEN BEZOS AND MUSK SOLD THEIR STOCK, I SOLD MINE TOO. I SOLD AMZN FOR $3530 AND TSLA FOR $1180, SO I'M SELLING HIGH. AT THAT TIME MY ACCOUNT INCREASED BY 120K PROFIT.  
AFTER THAT, I STARTED SHORTING, I KEPT SHORTING TSLA AND AMZN, WHICH BROUGHT ME OVER 250K IN PROFIT (INCLUDING 120K IN GOLD I BOUGHT HERE).  
ONE BACK AND FORTH AND I'VE MADE 390K. BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST WATCH THEIR PROFITS INCREASE AS THE STOCK MARKET GOES UP AND THEN DISAPPEAR WHEN THE STOCK MARKET GOES DOWN.  
  
ALSO, I THINK A DIVERSIFIED INVESTMENT STRATEGY SHOULD BE PRACTICED, WHICH IS THE GREATEST INVESTMENT STRATEGY OF THE 20TH CENTURY. FROM A LONG-TERM INVESTMENT PERSPECTIVE, THE BEST DIVERSIFICATION STRATEGIES ARE COMPREHENSIVE, INCLUDING DIVERSIFICATION AGAINST INFLATION, FINANCIAL CRISES, AND SOCIAL UNREST.  
WE CAN SELECTIVELY INVEST 40%-60% OF OUR CASH IN THE STOCK MARKET. IN THE STOCK MARKET, WE STILL FOLLOW A DIVERSIFIED INVESTMENT STRATEGY. INCLUDING TECHNOLOGY STOCKS, ENERGY STOCKS, CONSUMER STOCKS, FINANCIAL STOCKS, MEDICAL STOCKS AND EVEN INDICES, ETC., YOU CAN REFER TO MSFT/AAPL/CO/TSLA/XOM, ETC.;  
  
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN INVESTING NOW.  
AT PRESENT, DOMESTIC INFLATION IS VERY SERIOUS AND HAS EXCEEDED THE HIGHEST VALUE IN 40 YEARS. SOME FED OFFICIALS SAID A RATE HIKE WAS IMMINENT. THAT MEANS THE STOCK MARKET COULD FALL SHARPLY. AND, HISTORICALLY, FINANCIAL MARKETS HAVE HAD A FINANCIAL CRISIS EVERY 10 TO 20 YEARS. THE CURRENT SITUATION IS HIGH PRICES, HIGH HOUSING PRICES, HIGH INFLATION, AND HIGH DEBT. THE BASIC CONDITIONS FOR THE FINANCIAL CRISIS ARE ALREADY IN PLACE.  
SO, NOW IS DEFINITELY NOT THE BEST TIME TO INVEST.",hyqdp5y,t3_t2sh4x,1646018651,1646043851.0,/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/t2sh4x/31_starting_a_family_started_investing_during_the/hyqdp5y/

I WANT TO REBALANCE MY  TFSA PORTFOLIO SO THAT IT IS NOT SOLELY TECH. THIS IS NOT MONEY I’LL NEED FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. I’M MAINLY LOOKING FOR ADVICE AT ROUNDING OUT MY PORTFOLIO SO IT’S LESS RELIANT ON TECH (THOUGH I STILL WANT TO BE OVERWEIGHTED IN TECH).

NOTE: THESE POSITIONS ARE MOSTLY NEW (1.5 WEEKS AGO) ASIDE FROM VUN. I CASHED MOST OF MY CURRENT PORTFOLIO AT THE BEGINNING OF JANUARY AND HAVE BEEN HESITANT TO REENTER POSITIONS.

CURRENTLY AS IT STANDS MY PORTFOLIO IS AS FOLLOWS…
-	28% VUN (VTI)
-	27% CASH THAT I’M HESITANT TO DEPLOY DUE TO THE VOLATILITY.
-	18% MSFT
-	11% MVRS (FB)
-	10% GOOG
-	6% AAPL (NEW POSITION)

NOTE: I INTEND TO ADD PYPL SOON AS AN EXPOSURE TO FIN TECH. THIS POSITION WILL DEPLOY 4-5% OF CASH RESERVES.

WHAT STOCKS/ETFS SHOULD I CONSIDER TO COUNTERBALANCE MY HEAVY TECH PORTFOLIO?
I’M CURRENTLY LOOKING FOR STOCKS/ETFS THAT ARE…
-	NOT TECH
-	WELL-ESTABLISHED COMPANIES
-	PE UNDER 25
-	STRONG CASH RESERVES 
NOTE: I DON’T HAVE A PREFERENCE FOR OR AGAINST DIVIDENDS.

91,derailleurinthemist,CanadianInvestor,"HERE ARE A FEW THOUGHTS FROM THE UPPER BLEACHERS. A FEW FACTS AND THEN MY THOUGHTS

1) S AND P TOP STOCKS STILL HAVE VERY HIGH PE RATIO EVEN AFTER THIS WEEKS POOR SHOWING 

A FEW EXAMPLES AAPL PE OF 26;AMZN 53; BRKB 24.8 UNH 21.6; MSFT 32.2; GOOGLE 21.

AVERAGE EBITA IS HIGH AND AVERAGE PE IS STILL HIS

2) A TRILLION DOLLAR HAS BEEN WIPED OUT OF BITCOIN ALONE AND OTHER CRYPTO'S WHO KNOWS. NOTICE CRYPTO ENCOMPASSES THE WORK ""CRY"" ITS OBVIOUSLY IN NOT A SAFE HAVEN FOR INFLATION! ALSO CHECK OUT EL SALADOR'S USE OF IT....THE COUNTRY PURCHASED QUITE A BIT AND NOW MIGHT BE IN BANKRUPTCY MODE. HISTORY TELLS US WHAT HAPPENS WHEN COUNTRIES DEFAULT--LOOK TO NEW ZEALAND A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO. THE RIPPLES WILL COME OUR WAY.

3) CRYPTO HAS CONTINUED TO FALL THIS WEEKEND. MORE FOLKS ARE CASHING IN. MARGIN CALLS WILL COME ON MONDAY AND THE ""PET ROCK"" ASSET CLASS OF OUR TIME MIGHT TANK FURTHER. THUS FOLKS WILL BE TAKING MONEY OUT OF THE MARKET.

4) PEOPLE THAT HAVE BOUGHT OTHER STOCKS WILL GET MARGIN CALL PRESSURE AND STOCKS WILL SELL OFF AGAIN. HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT MONEY MANAGER HAVE BEEN SELLING THESE HIGH FLYERS SINCE NOVEMBER AND THE DIPS HAVE BEEN BOUGHT BY THE RETAIL INVESTORS ( NEVER A GOOD SIGN ). THE CHEAP MONEY THAT WENT IN WILL COME OUT OR BE LOST.

CONCLUSION:

I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF THE DROP IN THE S AND P AND NASDAQ CONTINUE FOR ABOUT 10-15 % DROP FROM HERE. REMEMBER IN MARCH OF 2020 THE DROP WITH COVID TOOK ABOUT A MONTH. THIS CORRECTION MIGHT BE FASTER.  

MARGIN CALLS COME NEXT WEEK FOR FOLKS. THEN COMES PERSONAL BANKRUPTCIES, SELLING OF HOMES AND RECESSION.

CANADIAN CENTRAL BANK WILL RAISE RATES .25 BUT WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF IT IS .50.

THE FED WILL SPEAK NEXT WEEK AND AGAIN .35 BUT WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE .50

THAT MIGHT HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE MARKET AS WELL.

THE CANADIAN MARKET SHOULD ALSO FOLLOW SUIT AND SELL OF FURTHER.

I PERSONALLY SWITCHED MY PORTFOLIO TO FINANCIALS, REITS AND OTHER DIVIDEND STOCKS ABOUT 6 MONTHS AGO. 

NOW SAYING THAT STOCKS DO RECOVER AND I HAVE SOLD A FEW THINGS LAST WEEK...BUT WILL SIT STILL AND RIDE THE WAVE. HAVE ABOUT 25% IN CASH RIGHT NOW TO PICK UP BARGAINS IN A FEW WEEKS ( I AM HOPING ).

TWO OTHER WILD CARD FACTORS!

1) RUSSIA WILL INVADE UKRAINE IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. MAYBE BEFORE THE WINTER OLYMPICS.

2) CHINA MIGHT MOVE ON HONG KONG AFTER THE OLYMPICS.  

THE US AN AND EU WILL NOT DO MUCH. ENERGY IN WINTER COMES TO THE EU VIA RUSSIAN AND THEY DON'T WANT THE TAPS TURNED OFF. THE US HAS SHOWN TO NOT HAVE A STOMACH FOR CONFLICT AFTER 20 YEARS IN AFGANISTAN. NO BOOTS ON THE GROUND BY ANY NATO NATION. THE TRIGGER FOR THIS WILL BE EMBASSY STAFF BEING REMOVED FROM KIEV. ONCE THAT STARTS THE LAND WAR WILL BEGIN IN A FEW DAYS.

GEOPOLITICAL RISK WILL ALSO PLAY ON THE MARKET! BUT WILL BE SHORT LIVED. LOOK AT THE MARKETS DURING GULF WAR 1 AND GW2 FOR EXAMPLES OF HOW IT EFFECT THE MARKETS.....

BOTTOM LINE WITH THIS DIATRIBE IS ""HOLD TIGHT"" BUY THINGS ON THE WAY DOWN AT ENTRY POINTS YOU ARE HAPPY WITH AND DON'T LOCK IN LOSSES. REMEMBER IF SOMEONE IS GOING TO DROP A BOMB...WE ARE NOT GOING TO NEED CASH BECAUSE WE ARE ALL DEAD! BUT IF THEY DON'T AND YOU BUY ON THE WAY DOWN WHEN IT RECOVERS ( AND IT WILL ACCORDING TO HISTORY ) YOU WILL HAVE A SMILE ON YOUR FACE!",htrpzd5,t3_sa5u49,1642874518,1642899718.0,/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/sa5u49/curious_on_your_thoughts_of_sp_500_2022_future/htrpzd5/

115,gcko,CanadianInvestor,"I BUY WHEN EVERYONE IS AFRAID, WAIT FOR SELL OFFS TO HAPPEN THEN BUY WHEN I THINK I’M GETTING A GOOD DEAL OR THE STOCK IS OVERSOLD. I USUALLY STICK TO GOOD COMPANIES OR ONES WITH LARGE MARKET CAPS. LET ME GIVE YOU A FEW RECENT EXAMPLES FROM LAST YEAR. 

I BOUGHT AAPL WHEN THE SAME THING WAS HAPPENING EARLIER IN 2021 (BIG MONEY ROTATING OUT OF TECH). ALMOST BOUGHT TSLA TOO WHEN BURRY CAME OUT THAT HE WAS SHORTING IT BUT IT NEVER HIT MY $500 TARGET ENTRY. ALMOST THOUGH.

I BOUGHT SU AND TD WHEN DELTA (COVID) WAS MAKING PEOPLE AFRAID OF FURTHER LOCKDOWNS AFTER THEY HAD A NICE LITTLE RUN EARLIER IN 2021 FOR THE SAME REASONS AS THEY DO NOW. FIGURED THEY’D POP RIGHT BACK UP AND THEY DID. 

I BUY BTC WHEN CHINA BANS IT. (YES THEY’VE DONE IT MORE THAN A FEW TIMES NOW)

SOMETIMES THE MARKET CORRECTS ITSELF ALMOST OVERNIGHT OR SOMETIMES IT TAKES A YEAR FOR SECTOR ROTATIONS TO REVERSE. EITHER WAY I BUY STOCKS I DON’T MIND HAVING IN MY PORTFOLIO LONG TERM AND JUST KEEP BUYING IF IT GOES LOWER. 

I DON’T REALLY WAIT ON THE SIDELINES FOR AN ENTRY. I’LL SOMETIMES KEEP ~5% CASH IN MY PORTFOLIO IF I JUST CLOSED A POSITION IN ORDER TO DO THIS BUT THE REST JUST GOES INTO MY ETFS IF NOTHING SEEMS INTERESTING THAT WEEK. I DON’T TRY TO MESS AROUND BY SELLING OR TIMING THESE. JUST BUY AND HOLD. IF A STOCK OR SECTOR IS GETTING BEATEN AND I THINK IT’S OVERSOLD OR PEOPLE ARE OVERREACTING THEN I’LL START USING MY BI-WEEKLY DEPOSITS TO BUY THAT, THEN EVENTUALLY ROLL MOST OF THE PROFITS INTO ETFS AND I EITHER KEEP THE REST OF THE POSITION OR EXIT COMPLETELY AND WAIT FOR FEAR TO COME BACK. RINSE AND REPEAT. 

SOMETIMES IT TAKES A WHILE BUT THAT’S WHY YOU ONLY BUY STUFF ON SALE YOU DON’T MIND HAVING LONG TERM ANYWAYS. 

YOU CAN DO THIS FOR SMALLER CAPS TOO BUT IT’S OBVIOUSLY MUCH RISKIER IN TERMS OF HOLDING THE BAG. CURRENTLY DOING IT WITH NUMI. I’VE ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED IN THE SECTOR BUT MISSED THE “SHROOM BOOM” SO I JUST WAITED. I FINALLY BOUGHT AT 0.50 JUST BEFORE XMAS PLANNING TO DCA AND IT’S BEEN SWINGING BETWEEN THAT AND 0.70 LATELY SO I’VE BEEN SWING TRADING IT WITH ABOUT 30-50% OF MY POSITION. I NOW HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF SHARES I INITIALLY HAD, BUT MY INITIAL CAPITAL HAS BEEN TAKEN OUT AS PROFITS ALREADY SO I CAN REST EASY EVEN IF I HAVE TO BAG HOLD FOR 5 YEARS KNOWING IT’S JUST MONEY I DIDN’T HAVE SO NOT A BIG DEAL IF IT DISAPPEARS (I ADMIT I GOT LUCKY WITH THIS ONE, THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO TAKE MUCH LONGER BUT YOU GET THE IDEA). 

TIMING THE BOTTOM IS JUST AS HARD AS TIMING THE TOP. JUST WAIT FOR THE KNIFE THE FALL AND FIND SUPPORT. OBVIOUSLY THAT DOESN’T WORK EVERY TIME BUT THE WAY I LOOK AT IT, IS IF AAPL IS SITTING AT A PRICE I WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE THAN HAPPY TO BUY 4-6 MONTHS AGO THEN WHY AM I NOT BUYING NOW?",ht1e93y,t3_s5bdj4,1642428180,1642453380.0,/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/s5bdj4/brookfield_asset_management_bamato/ht1e93y/

LIKELY BECAUSE THE USD GOT STRONGER THAN THE CAD THAT DAY, WHICH MEANS YOU’RE ALREADY GETTING THE RETURNS OF THE USD/CAD WHEN BUYING WHEN THE CAD IS STRONG, WITHIN VFV, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT IS UNHEDGED FROM THE CAD.

OF COURSE THE STRENGTH OF THE CAD PLAYS A PART IN PURCHASING US STOCKS, FOR INSTANCE I CONVERT MY CAD TO USD WHEN THE CAD IS ABOVE 0.80 SO I CAN BUY MORE BRK AND AAPL. BUT NOT US ETFS DENOMINATED IN CAD. IT’S ALREADY PRICED INTO THE ETF WHETHER IT’S HEDGED OR UNHEDGED.

I COULD GO INTO MORE ADVANCED EXAMPLES BUT CURRENCY CONSIDERATIONS AND BENEFITING FROM THEM ARE MORE OF AN INTERMEDIATE/ADVANCED INVESTORS REALM OF CHOICES. YOU SEEM TO BE STILL LEARNING QUITE A BIT.

I BOUGHT BOTH BB AND AAPL 12 YEARS AGO AS I WASN’T SURE WHICH WOULD COME OUT ON TOP. STILL HAVE BOTH. BB IS FOR ALL INTENTS AND PURPOSES IS ZERO. I WAS AMUSED WHEN IT WAS BRIEFLY A MEME STOCK. AAPL HAS MADE UP FOR BB’S UNDERPERFORMANCE. 

DESPITE THIS GENERAL APPROACH, I AM INTENTIONALLY OVERWEIGHT OIL AND GOLD. I WAS AGGRESSIVE ON OIL WHEN WTI WENT NEGATIVE IN 2020 AND HAVE BEEN ACCUMULATING A HEAVY GOLD POSITION OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS. 

MY VIEW IS THAT HIGH INFLATION WILL BE WITH US FOR YEARS AND THERE’S NOTHING THE CENTRAL BANKS CAN DO ABOUT IT. RATES WILL GO UP 150 BPS AT MOST BEFORE THE CENTRAL BANKS WILL BE FORCED TO EASE AGAIN. I THINK REAL RATES WILL BE NEGATIVE FOR MOST IF NOT ALL OF THIS DECADE.
