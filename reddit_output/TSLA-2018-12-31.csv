WOULD REPLACE [RNW.TO](HTTPS://RNW.TO) WITH A FINANCIAL LIKE RY OR TD OR CM

TSLA BEING A SPEC STOCK IS TOO RISKY. BUT SINCE YOU'RE YOUNG TIME IS ON YOUR SIDE IF THINGS DON'T GO WELL FOR TSLA.

[WPM.TO](HTTPS://WPM.TO) NOT A BIG FAN OF PRECIOUS METALS, RISKY PLAY WOULD RATHER HAVE STEADY CASH FLOW.

5,langlois44,CanadianInvestor,"OF COURSE NOT.

/U/JUGWHATEVER GAVE YOU A WHOLE BUNCH OF STOCKS WHICH COULD BE DESCRIBED AS ""GROWTH STOCKS"" (THOUGH I'M AGAINST THE NEEDLESS CATEGORIZATION OF STOCKS). THERE ARE DOZENS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF OTHER COMPANIES WITH LONG TRACK RECORDS OF GROWING REVENUES, EARNINGS, AND THEIR SHARE PRICE. JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T SEE THEM, OR CHOOSE TO CATEGORIZE THEM AS SOMETHING ELSE, DOESN'T MEAN THERE ISN'T ANY GROWTH IN THE CANADIAN MARKETS. 

* THERE ARE LOTS OF MINING STOCKS WHICH ARE NOT PUMP AND DUMPS, REGARDLESS OF YOUR FEELINGS. THEY'RE NOT FOR EVERYONE, BUT THERE ARE MANY SUCH STOCKS GROWING LIKE GANGBUSTERS, WITH REAL ASSETS WHICH SELL REAL GOODS.
* WHERE ARE RETAIL OR CONSUMER STOCKS IN YOUR CLASSIFICATIONS? LOOK AT CANADIAN TIRE, CANADA GOOSE, ALIMENTATION COUCHE-TARD, MTY, ETC.
* WITHOUT THE NEED TO CLASSIFY COMPANIES INTO SECTORS - SJ, CN, CP, BAM.A, IFC, LNR, DRM, MEQ, CAR.UN, PIF, GUD, MRC, IAM, PLC, GSY, BUS, MG, DAP.U, PBL, ETC. SOME OF THESE YOU MIGHT DISMISS AS ""VALUE"" OR ""DIVIDEND GROWTH"" BUT IF THEY'VE BEEN GROWING EARNINGS AT 10+% A YEAR, IT'S RIDICULOUS TO DISMISS THEM AS NOT ""GROWTH"" STOCKS.

IN YOUR REPLY TO /U/JUGWHATEVER, YOU SAY: 

&GT;  I AGREE THAT THERE IS CERTAINLY GROWTH TO BE HAD IN CANADA, BUT IT'S  NOTHING LIKE THE US. I LOOKED AT SOME OF THE COMPANIES YOU LISTED, AND  OVERALL NOT TOO IMPRESSED COMPARED TO U.S GROWTH. 

TALK ABOUT MOVING THE GOAL POSTS. ""OKAY FINE, THERE IS GROWTH IN CANADIAN STOCKS, BUT NOT AS MUCH AS IN THE US!"" SURE, NOBODY HERE WILL ARGUE THAT. BUT YOU REALIZE THE POPULATION OF THE POPULATION OF THE US IS 10X OF CANADA'S? WHY WOULD WE HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF GROWTH STOCKS AS THEM?  

AND SECOND, HOW MUCH OF THE US' GROWTH ARE YOU ATTRIBUTING TO A FEW OUTLIERS? WHEN THE US MARKET IS PREDOMINANTLY AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, AND MSFT, AND THEY'VE HAD A LOT OF STOCKS GROW WELL PAST THEIR INTRINSIC VALUE (NFLX, TSLA, ETC), OBVIOUSLY THE US WILL LOOK LIKE IT HAS GREATER GROWTH.  

IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU'VE FALLEN VICTIM TO THE AVAILABILITY HEURISTIC. US STOCKS ARE COVERED MORE IN THE MEDIA, ON REDDIT, IN FORUMS, ETC MAKING THEIR GROWTH STOCKS VERY EASY TO RECALL. IT IS EASIER TO MAKE AN ERRONEOUS BLANKET STATEMENT LIKE ""YOU CAN'T BE A GROWTH INVESTOR IN CANADIAN STOCKS"" THAN IT IS TO SPEND HOURS RESEARCHING POLLARD BANKNOTE OR XPEL TECHNOLOGIES. WHEN STOCKS HAVE GROWN A LOT BUT ARE STILL CHEAP (LINAMAR, MAGNA, MORGUARD) IT IS EASY TO SAY ""NAH, THOSE ARE VALUE STOCKS - WHO CARES IF THEY'VE GROWN A LOT - THE P/E IS 6X!"" 

THE BIGGEST AND EASIEST STOCKS TO THINK OF IN THE US CAN REASONABLY BE CALLED ""GROWTH STOCKS"", WHEREAS THE BIGGEST AND EASIEST STOCKS TO THINK OF IN CANADA ARE BANKS, FORTIS, BCE, ETC, WHAT YOU'VE DECIDED TO CALL ""DIVIDEND GROWTH OR VALUE"" STOCKS (WHICH I ARGUE IS AN OVERSIMPLIFICATION).
