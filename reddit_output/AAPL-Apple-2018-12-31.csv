1,johnnychi,CanadianInvestor,"I HAVE BEEN WORRIED IN THE BACK OF MY MIND ABOUT THIS POLITICAL FOOTBALL. I THINK THE HUAWEI ISSUE IS A POLITICAL FOOTBALL AND NOT A NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE. WAS THERE EXPLICIT PROOF ASIDE FROM ""IT'S CHINESE"" AND ""THE CHINESE ARE ALL EVIL SO THEIR COMPANIES MUST BE DOING WHAT EVERY OTHER TECHNOLOGY COMPANY IS LIKELY DOING AS WELL""? (TO MAKE IT SIMPLE INSTEAD OF LISTING THEM SUCH AS INTEL BACKDOORS CISCO ROUTERS, AT&AMP;T SECRET INSTALLATION, ETC. JUST LOOK UP SNOWDEN.)

&AMP;#X200B;

REMEMBER THE ""CHINESE INSTALLED CHIPS THAT CAN BYPASS YOUR PROTECTIONS"" SCAREMONGERING THAT FIZZLED IN A FEW DAYS AFTER BOTH AAPL AND AMZN DEMANDED BLOOMBERG RETRACT THEIR STORY FOR A LACK OF PROOF. EVEN SECURITY EXPERTS DID NOT AGREE WITH THE HIT PIECE. I WAS TAKEN INTO IT, BUT AFTER SEEING THE RESULTING FALLOUT NOW HAVE DOUBTS AND CONTINUE TO THINK WE ARE BEING INFLUENCED FOR SOME GROUPS' POLITICAL GAINS.

DURING A FAIRLY RECENT INTERVIEW WITH THE BCE CEO I DID DETECT A CHANGE IN VOICE WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE IMPACT OF HUAWEI.

3,langlois44,CanadianInvestor,"OF COURSE NOT.

/U/JUGWHATEVER GAVE YOU A WHOLE BUNCH OF STOCKS WHICH COULD BE DESCRIBED AS ""GROWTH STOCKS"" (THOUGH I'M AGAINST THE NEEDLESS CATEGORIZATION OF STOCKS). THERE ARE DOZENS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF OTHER COMPANIES WITH LONG TRACK RECORDS OF GROWING REVENUES, EARNINGS, AND THEIR SHARE PRICE. JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T SEE THEM, OR CHOOSE TO CATEGORIZE THEM AS SOMETHING ELSE, DOESN'T MEAN THERE ISN'T ANY GROWTH IN THE CANADIAN MARKETS. 

* THERE ARE LOTS OF MINING STOCKS WHICH ARE NOT PUMP AND DUMPS, REGARDLESS OF YOUR FEELINGS. THEY'RE NOT FOR EVERYONE, BUT THERE ARE MANY SUCH STOCKS GROWING LIKE GANGBUSTERS, WITH REAL ASSETS WHICH SELL REAL GOODS.
* WHERE ARE RETAIL OR CONSUMER STOCKS IN YOUR CLASSIFICATIONS? LOOK AT CANADIAN TIRE, CANADA GOOSE, ALIMENTATION COUCHE-TARD, MTY, ETC.
* WITHOUT THE NEED TO CLASSIFY COMPANIES INTO SECTORS - SJ, CN, CP, BAM.A, IFC, LNR, DRM, MEQ, CAR.UN, PIF, GUD, MRC, IAM, PLC, GSY, BUS, MG, DAP.U, PBL, ETC. SOME OF THESE YOU MIGHT DISMISS AS ""VALUE"" OR ""DIVIDEND GROWTH"" BUT IF THEY'VE BEEN GROWING EARNINGS AT 10+% A YEAR, IT'S RIDICULOUS TO DISMISS THEM AS NOT ""GROWTH"" STOCKS.

IN YOUR REPLY TO /U/JUGWHATEVER, YOU SAY: 

&GT;  I AGREE THAT THERE IS CERTAINLY GROWTH TO BE HAD IN CANADA, BUT IT'S  NOTHING LIKE THE US. I LOOKED AT SOME OF THE COMPANIES YOU LISTED, AND  OVERALL NOT TOO IMPRESSED COMPARED TO U.S GROWTH. 

TALK ABOUT MOVING THE GOAL POSTS. ""OKAY FINE, THERE IS GROWTH IN CANADIAN STOCKS, BUT NOT AS MUCH AS IN THE US!"" SURE, NOBODY HERE WILL ARGUE THAT. BUT YOU REALIZE THE POPULATION OF THE POPULATION OF THE US IS 10X OF CANADA'S? WHY WOULD WE HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF GROWTH STOCKS AS THEM?  

AND SECOND, HOW MUCH OF THE US' GROWTH ARE YOU ATTRIBUTING TO A FEW OUTLIERS? WHEN THE US MARKET IS PREDOMINANTLY AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, AND MSFT, AND THEY'VE HAD A LOT OF STOCKS GROW WELL PAST THEIR INTRINSIC VALUE (NFLX, TSLA, ETC), OBVIOUSLY THE US WILL LOOK LIKE IT HAS GREATER GROWTH.  

IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU'VE FALLEN VICTIM TO THE AVAILABILITY HEURISTIC. US STOCKS ARE COVERED MORE IN THE MEDIA, ON REDDIT, IN FORUMS, ETC MAKING THEIR GROWTH STOCKS VERY EASY TO RECALL. IT IS EASIER TO MAKE AN ERRONEOUS BLANKET STATEMENT LIKE ""YOU CAN'T BE A GROWTH INVESTOR IN CANADIAN STOCKS"" THAN IT IS TO SPEND HOURS RESEARCHING POLLARD BANKNOTE OR XPEL TECHNOLOGIES. WHEN STOCKS HAVE GROWN A LOT BUT ARE STILL CHEAP (LINAMAR, MAGNA, MORGUARD) IT IS EASY TO SAY ""NAH, THOSE ARE VALUE STOCKS - WHO CARES IF THEY'VE GROWN A LOT - THE P/E IS 6X!"" 

THE BIGGEST AND EASIEST STOCKS TO THINK OF IN THE US CAN REASONABLY BE CALLED ""GROWTH STOCKS"", WHEREAS THE BIGGEST AND EASIEST STOCKS TO THINK OF IN CANADA ARE BANKS, FORTIS, BCE, ETC, WHAT YOU'VE DECIDED TO CALL ""DIVIDEND GROWTH OR VALUE"" STOCKS (WHICH I ARGUE IS AN OVERSIMPLIFICATION).

THE CANADIAN INDICES HAVE BASICALLY DONE NOTHING, ESPECIALLY IN $USD$, SINCE 2008.  SO I'D EXPECT THEM TO SOLIDLY OUTPERFORM THE US IN A RECESSION.  

&GT;I'VE HEARD FOLKS SAY THEY WON'T TOUCH CHINESE OR EMERGING MARKETS UNTIL THE TRADE TENSIONS SIMMER, WOULD IT BE WISE IN YOUR OPINION TO FOLLOW THAT ADVICE?

VWO/EEM HAVE DONE NOTHING IN USD$ SINCE 2008.  SIMILAR DEAL.  

&GT;IS IT COMMON TO PARK A DECENT SUM OF MONEY IN A CLASSIC STOCK LIKE AMZN OR AAPL INSTEAD OF A BROAD ETF? IS THAT A HIGHER RISK HIGHER REWARD SCENARIO?

THOSE COMPANIES HAVE HAD THEIR DAYS IN THE SUN.  USUALLY AFTER A RECESSION, SOME OTHER SECTOR TAKES THE LEAD.  I'D CONSIDER THOSE COMPANIES TO BE INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS TO INVEST IN WITH LOW IMPLIED FUTURE RETURNS.

&GT;IS THE GENERAL CONSENSUS, THAT THE USD WILL MOST LIKELY RISE COMPARED TO THE CAD?

USD$ STRENGTH IS SELF-LIMITING, THE US TRADE DEFICITS ARE NOT INDEFINITELY SUSTAINABLE.  

&GT;IN MY YOUNG 20'S AM I BETTER OFF CHOOSING NON-DIVIDEND-FOCUSED ETFS? ASSUMING I DON'T PRESSINGLY NEED THE RECURRING MONEY.

I'M A FAN OF TAKING 70-80% OF YOUR MONEY, STICKING IT IN BROAD-MARKET ETFS, AND TAKING THE OTHER 20-30% AND INVESTING IT INTO THE SORTS OF THINGS YOU THINK ARE UNDERVALUED.  TOO MANY, PARTICULARLY YOUNGER PEOPLE, PUT IT ALL INTO SOME FAD STOCK, GET BURNED, AND THEN NEVER INVEST AGAIN IN THEIR LIFETIMES.

AAPL, MSFT, GOOG ARE REAL BUSINESSES WITH SUPERB FUNDAMENTALS AND HUGE MARKET SHARE AND MOATS.  

NFLX (AND AMZN TO A LESS DEGREE) ARE MORE SPECULATIVE, WITH LITTLE TO NO EARNINGS, INSANE MULTIPLES, LOTS OF SPENDING, AND WALKING AROUND WITH TARGETS ON THEIR BACKS FROM COMPETITORS.  

EVEN SO, NFLX AND AMZN WOULD HAVE KILLED IT OVER THOSE TIME FRAMES VERSUS THE MORE SENSIBLE AND ANALYTICAL CHOICES.

I WOULD ONLY ADD NORBERT'S GAMBIT IS AN INEXPENSIVE WAY TO CONVERT CAD TO USD (AND VICE VERSA).

AN ADVANTAGE TO INVESTING WITH USD IS THAT YOU GET ACCESS TO US-LISTED STOCKS AND ETFS. THE US-LISTED ETFS FOR WHICH THERE IS AN EQUIVALENT IN CANADA TEND TO BE MARGINALLY CHEAPER BUT THERE ARE MANY US-LISTED ETFS THAT JUST AREN’T AVAILABLE IN CANADA (SINGLE COUNTRY MARKETS, SECTOR SPECIALIZATION, ESG, ETC). 

THE BIGGER ADVANTAGE IS THAT THERE ARE PROBABLY MORE VARIETY OF US “BLUE CHIP” COMPANIES (ESPECIALLY TECH) THAT INTEREST YOU AS INVESTMENTS, LIKE APPLE (AAPL), GOOGLE (GOOGL), FACEBOOK (FB), ETC. YOU CAN GET TINY SLICES OF THESE THROUGH ETFS (ALONG WITH THOUSANDS OF OTHER COMPANIES AT THE SAME TIME, WHICH IS GOOD). BUT IF YOU WANT TO FOLLOW YOUR DAD'S APPROACH BY SELECTING SINGLE COMPANIES THEN YOU MIGHT WANT TO INCREASE THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO YOU.

ALL THAT SAID, I WOULD RECOMMEND STICKING TO ETFS UNTIL YOU’VE DEVELOPED SOME SKILL AT SECURITY ANALYSIS.

114,PlatypusOfWallStreet,CanadianInvestor,"NICE AND DIVERSIFIED! I LIKE IT, GOOD JOB. :)

I CANT SUGGEST WHAT YOU SHOULD HOLD (OR SELL IF YOU WANT TO ALLOCATE SOME OF THEM TO MY SUGGESTIONS).. BUT I WILL SUGGEST THAT YOU SHOULD CONSIDER ADDING MORE TECH IN HERE. ITS BECOMING EVERYTHING... LITERALLY, AS WE SPEAK. AND AS SOME ONE WORKS IN THIS INDUSTRY, I HAVE BEEN BLESSED AS BEING AN INVESTOR WHO IS WORKING IN THE HOTTEST INDUSTRY OF 2018 WHO IS SEEING FIRST HAND THE TRANSFORMATION THAT IS TAKING PLACE... I CANT STRESS THIS ENOUGH. EVERY SINGLE COMPANY LISTED IN YOUR POST RELIES ON IT... MORE AND MORE. SO DO ALL CONSUMERS, EVEN THIRD WORLD COUNTRIES THAT HAVE A HARD TIME PROVIDING FRESH WATER, OFFER PEOPLE PHONES CONNECTED THE INTERNET FOR CHEAP... ITS EVER GROWING/EVOLVING WITH BETTER TECHNOLOGY EXPONENTIALLY THAT PEOPLE DONT EVEN REALIZE AS CONSUMERS (THINGS WE DEEMED SCIENCE FICTION LIKE SELF DRIVING CARS, AI ROBOTS, ETC ARE THE JUST THE TIP OF THIS REVOLUTION).

PEOPLE IN THIS SUBREDDIT WILL SAY THAT INDEXES ARE BETTER THAN STOCKS IN TERMS OF RETURNS... BUT WHEN IT COMES TO TECH. IT IS JUST NOT TRUE WHEN COMPARED TO THE TECH GOLIATHS IN THE INDUSTRY. DOW JONES AND S&AMP;P HAVE HAD A ROCKY YEAR (NOT HITTING ATH) BUT TECH INDUSTRY? NO PROBLEM. QQQ IS THE INDEX I LOOK AT FOR TECH AND ITS JUST FINE (EVEN WITH THE WILD TRUMP RELATED SWINGS/CORRECTIONS THIS YEAR). I MEAN YOU MUST HAVE EXPERIENCED IT YOURSELF THE SIDEWAYS/DOWNWARD DIRECTION WITH SOME OF THE STOCKS YOU HAVE CHOSEN IN RECENT YEARS. THIS CAN BE AVOIDED WITH TECH AND NO IF ANYONE IS THINKING THIS... 2018 IS NOTHING LIKE THE DOTCOM ERA. APPLE, MICROSOFT, GOOGLE AND AMAZON BECOMING NEARLY TRILLION DOLLAR COMPANIES IS JUSTIFIED WITH THE SCALE THEIR BUSINESSES OPERATE AT.

MY FIRST SUGGESTION: **CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE.** LOOK FOR COMPANIES THAT ARE GROWING THEIR CLOUD PLATFORM MASSIVELY. WHILE APPLE DOES DO THIS... I PERSONALLY INVEST IN THEM MORE FOR CONSUMER GOODS THAN ANYTHING ELSE (WITH PHONES BEING THE LEADING CAUSE FOR THEIR SALES), ITS STILL A SOLID CHOICE BUT SHOULDN'T BE THE ONLY MAJOR TECH COMPANY IN YOUR PORTFOLIO. THEIR CLOUD BUSINESS IS NOT AT THE SCALE OF GOOGLE, MICROSOFT AND AMAZON. HAVE YOUR PICK BETWEEN THESE. PERSONALLY.. I WOULD PICK MICROSOFT, THEY HAVE DONE EXCEPTIONALLY WELL IN THE LAST 2 YEARS WITHOUT A SINGLE HICCUP AND HAVE REALLY TURNED THEIR COMPANY AROUND FROM THE PAST (GROWING THEIR CLOUD BUSINESS EVERY QUARTER BY 80-120%!) AND THIS IS STILL IN ITS INFACY AS THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE BUSINESSES AROUND THE WORLD HAVE NOT SWITCHED OVER THE CLOUD... BUT IN 2018 AS IT BECOMES COST EFFECTIVIE AND MORE IMPORTANTLY BETTER SOLUTION THAN HALF THE SERVICES PROVIDED ELSEWHERE... IT GOING TO BECOME INVITABLE THAT COMPANIES GO IN THE DIRECTION OF BEING SEMI CLOUD(HYBRID ENVIRONMENT) OR 100% CLOUD.

MY SECOND SUGGESTION :**SEMI CONDUCTORS.** WITH EVERYTHING BECOMING COMPUTERIZED, THEY WILL NEED SEMI CONDUCTORS IN ORDER TO BECOME... WELL COMPUTERS. COMPANIES LIKE NVIDIA, INTEL, AMD, MICRON, ETC. PERSONALLY I FAVOR NVIDIA AND MICRON, THEY ARE BOTH IN SPECIAL PLACES TODAY THAT IS UNIQUELY THEIRS... INTEL IS HAVING A MESSY YEAR WITH LOTS OF CONTROVERSIES... WHILE AMD MIGHT JUST BECOME A GROWTH STOCK OF 2018 (BUT THE P/E IS ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUS AND IT HAS HAD A ROCKY 1 YEAR FOR ME TO RECOMMEND IT AS THE CHOICE AT THIS POINT). WITH THESE YOU INVOLVE YOURSELF WITH HARDWARE FOR ALL KINDS OF TECHNOLOGIES. WHETHER ITS CLOUD DATA SERVERS, MODERN CARS, VIDEO GAMES, PERSONAL COMPUTERS/LAPTOPS/PHONES, AI COMPUTING, ETC.

MY THIRD SUGGESTION: **FINTECH** I SEE BANKS IN YOUR PICKS BUT I DONT SEE PAYMENT PROCESSOR COMPANIES. RBC IS NICE AND ALL... BUT WHEN YOU BUY THEIR CARDS... WHAT DO YOU GET? A VISA OR A MASTER CARD. THE SAME IS TRUE FOR NEARLY EVERY BANK IN THE WORLD. THESE ARE A MUST HAVE PICKS OF 2018 WHEN YOU CONSIDER HOW FAST AS A SOCIETY WE ARE GOING CASHLESS. MY ONLY REGRET IS NOT PUTTING MORE MONEY IN THIS SOONER. AND IT'S MY SAFESTS BET WITH A VERY STEADY GROWTH PACE.

MY FORTH SUGGESTION: **GAMING** I DONT KNOW YOUR PERCEPTIVE ABOUT VIDEO GAMES. BUT ITS BECOME A CULTURAL REVOLUTION. WE ARE LIVING THROUGH THE RENAISSANCE OF GAMING THAT IS CHANGING THE OLD NOTIONS WE HAD TO ATARI. SO MUCH SO THAT ITS BECOMING A LIFESTYLE (I AM SURE YOU HAVE KIDS/NEPHEWS/NIECES OBSESSED WITH FORTNITE). THERE IS A WHOLE COMMUNITY AROUND GAMING. THERE ARE MORE FEMALE GAMERS NOW THAN EVER BEFORE. MORE ADULT GAMERS NOW THAN EVER BEFORE. EVEN SPORTS IS EVOLVING IN THIS DIRECTION WHERE YOU WILL SEE A FEW GUYS PLAYING ON A COMPUTER ON ESPN SPORTS CHANNELS. ACTIVISION, TAKE TWO &AMP; EA ARE THE TOP THREE PICKS. I SUGGEST ACTIVISION BECAUSE OF THEIR PUSH TOWARDS ESPORTS (THEY ARE FILLING UP ARENAS LIKE A BOXING MATCH... ONLY IT HAS TWO GUYS ON A COMPUTER IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RING, LOL)

NO TIMELINE. ALSO WHY ARE WE FORWARD LOOKING? IN 10 YEARS SURE, ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN.   


ALSO, THEY PAY 12.8B LAST YEAR IN DIVIDENDS. THEY BOUGHT BACK 12B WORTH OF STOCK. TOTAL RETURNED, 24.8B. THEY REINVESTED 46.446B.

LOOK AT THEIR FILINGS OVER THE LAST 2 YEARS WHERE THEY UNDENIABLY SPED UP PAYOUTS. THEY STILL MAKE OODLES MORE THAN THEY RETURN TO SHAREHOLDERS AND SIT ON WADS OF CASH. GROWTH IS SOLELY CORPORATE STRATEGY BASED ON NPV OF AVAILABLE PROJECTS FOR RE-INVESTMENT. CIBC, TD, AAPL, CPG, BTE, SHOP ARE ALL GROWING. THEY ALL TRY TO GROW. THEY ARE NOT ALL GROWTH COMPANIES.

AN ADVANTAGE TO INVESTING WITH USD IS THAT YOU GET ACCESS TO US-LISTED STOCKS AND ETFS. THE US-LISTED ETFS FOR WHICH THERE IS AN EQUIVALENT IN CANADA TEND TO BE MARGINALLY CHEAPER BUT THERE ARE MANY US-LISTED ETFS THAT JUST AREN’T AVAILABLE IN CANADA (SINGLE COUNTRY MARKETS, SECTOR SPECIALIZATION, ESG, ETC). 

THE BIGGER ADVANTAGE IS THAT THERE ARE PROBABLY MORE VARIETY OF US “BLUE CHIP” COMPANIES (ESPECIALLY TECH) THAT INTEREST YOU AS INVESTMENTS, LIKE APPLE (AAPL), GOOGLE (GOOGL), FACEBOOK (FB), ETC. YOU CAN GET TINY SLICES OF THESE THROUGH ETFS (ALONG WITH THOUSANDS OF OTHER COMPANIES AT THE SAME TIME, WHICH IS GOOD). BUT IF YOU WANT TO FOLLOW YOUR DAD'S APPROACH BY SELECTING SINGLE COMPANIES THEN YOU MIGHT WANT TO INCREASE THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO YOU.

ALL THAT SAID, I WOULD RECOMMEND STICKING TO ETFS UNTIL YOU’VE DEVELOPED SOME SKILL AT SECURITY ANALYSIS.
