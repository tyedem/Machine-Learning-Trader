1,imgram,CanadianInvestor,"GOING TO GO AGAINST THE GRAIN OF THE RETAIL INVESTING CONSENSUS AND SAY RIDESHARING. 

I LIKE TO PICK SOME SECURITIES WHERE I BELIEVE THE MARKET THESIS IS INCORRECT. FOR INSTANCE, WHEN AAPL DEVALUED LAST YEAR BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT DECLINING UNIT SALES BUT IGNORING THE LIFETIME VALUE OF THE CUSTOMER THAT COMES WITH SERVICES AND WEARABLES.

THE GENERAL CONSENSUS AMONG A LOT OF INVESTORS SEEMS TO BE THAT RIDESHARING (LYFT/UBER) IS LOSING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND HAVE NO PATH TO PROFITABILITY. WHERE I THINK PEOPLE ARE UNDERESTIMATING THE TWO COMPANIES IS THE ELEVATED SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION THAT OCCURS WITH ANY IPO. DEPENDING ON HOW YOU WANT TO ADJUST OR NORMALIZE FOR THAT, I'D PEG THE BUSINESSES AT ROUGHLY A -25% OPERATING MARGIN WHICH ADMITTEDLY IS PRETTY BAD. HOWEVER, WITH TAKE-RATES IN THE ~20-25% RANGE, IF THEY ARE ABLE TO INCREASE PRICES BY ~5% (EITHER THROUGH HIGH PRICES/LOWER PROMOTIONS), THIS GETS THEM TO ROUGHLY BREAK-EVEN WHEN ELEVATED NEAR-TERM SBC IS ADJUSTED FOR. 

WHETHER THIS OCCURS OR NOT IS ANYONE'S GUESS BUT IF THE COMPANIES ADOPT A PRICE LEADER, PRICE FOLLOWER DYNAMIC, THE ROAD TO PROFITABILITY WILL BE CLEAR BY THE END OF 2020 AND I THINK THE SHARES WILL RE-RATE UP. AS FAR AS I CAN TELL, MANAGEMENT SEEMS TO BE SIGNALLING THAT PROFITABILITY IS IMPORTANT BUT THE MARKET IS LARGELY UNCONVINCED RIGHT NOW. IF YOU VIEW THE MARKET DYNAMICS OF RIDE SHARE THROUGH THE LENS OF THE RULE OF 3, BOTH UBER AND LYFT BENEFIT FROM NO LONGER TRYING TO CAPTURE MORE MARKET SHARE BUT STARTING TO RATIONALIZE PRICING.",fb70o8i,t3_ebgngo,1576568001,1576593201.0,/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/ebgngo/2020_picks/fb70o8i/

8,hokageace,CanadianInvestor,"I WILL START BY SAYING YOU SHOULD NOT MAKE SERIOUS INVESTMENT DECISIONS BASED ON ADVICE GIVEN BY STRANGERS ONLINE.

THAT SAID...

THIS IS NOT AN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY, HOW MUCH DO YOU KNOW ABOUT INVESTMENTS? IF NOT MUCH THEN VERY IMPRESSIVE BECAUSE YOU COULD DO A LOT WORSE. 

YOU SHOULD TALK TO SOME FINANCIAL ADVISORS AS YOU ARE CLOSE TO THE FUNDS THEY TAKE ON IF YOU DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT INVESTING. I AM TALKING ABOUT THOSE WHO CAN PROVIDE ADVICE ON INDIVIDUAL STOCKS AND NOT YOUR AVERAGE BANK ONE WHICH CAN ONLY SELL YOU MUTUAL FUNDS. IF YOU GO THIS ROUTE, WATCH OUT FOR FEES AS I DON'T THINK ANYTHING HIGHER THAN 1-1.2% IS WORTH IT.

IF YOU STILL WANT TO GO AT IT INDIVIDUALLY....STUDY AND EDUCATE YOURSELF BUT HERE ARE SOME THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND.

FIRST IS POSITION SIZING. CONVENTIONAL WISDOM SAYS YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE MORE THAN 7% IN AN INDIVIDUAL STOCK TO REDUCE SINGLE STOCK RISK UNLESS YOU ARE A PRO. ETFS DO NOT COUNT. I WOULD DEFINATELY REDUCE TD SIGNIFICANTLY AND ALL OTHERS TO 7% OR 10% AT MOST.

VFV IS A VERY GOOD ETF AND YOU WOULD NOT GO WRONG IF IT'S 100% OF YOUR PORTFOLIO. YOU WOULD PROBABLY OUTPERFORM MOST ADVISORS WITH JUST THAT. HOWEVER, YOU SHOULD LOOK AT GETTING THE US VERSION LISTED ON A US EXCHANGE IN USD. I BELIEVE USD IS A BETTER CURRENCY LONG TERM (LOOK UP NORBERT'S GAMBIT FOR EXCHANGE) AND IF YOU HOLD IT IN AN A NON-REGISTERED ACCOUNT OR TFSA, THERE ARE TAX IMPACTS ON CANADIAN LISTED ONES. I WOULD ALSO PICK VTI BECAUSE IT'S ALL MARKET AND VFV IS ABOUT 80% OF MARKET AND DOES NOT HAVE SMALLER COMPANIES WHICH HISTORICALLY OUTPERFORM.

I WOULD GET RID OF THE BOND INDEX SIMPLY DUE TO YOUR TIME HORIZON. I WOULD SAY START TO THINK ABOUT BONDS AT 10 YEARS FROM RETIREMENT OR WHEN YOU NEED TO ACCESS THE FUNDS.

I WOULD GET RID OF THE BAM SUB AND JUST KEEP BAM. IT IS A SUPERIOR INVESTMENT.

REST OF STOCKS ARE GREAT. I WOULD LOOK AT AQN AND ATD.B AS WELL IN CANADA. GREAT CHOICE WITH NOT GETTING A CANADIAN ETF BECAUSE THEY ARE FULL OF GARBAGE IN ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES.

50,ZivSerb,CanadianInvestor,"NO NO, CIBC DID CHARGE ME WHT IN MY TFSA WHEN HOLDING A US DIVIDEND-PAYING EQUITY. I HELD XLF AND AAPL FOR A LARGE CHUNK OF LAST YEAR AND THE WITHHOLDING TAX (15%) WAS DEDUCTED UPON EACH DIVIDEND PAYMENT. SORRY IF THE WORDING WAS CONFUSING. 

THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE IN AN RRSP, IT JUST MAKES MORE SENSE TO HAVE THEM IN AN RRSP TO AVOID THE WITHHOLDING TAX YOU'D BE SUBJECTED TO IF THEY WERE IN A TFSA. 

HONESTLY THE QUESTION ABOUT WHICH BROKER HAS BEEN ONE THAT I'VE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH FOR THE BETTER PART OF A YEAR. FOR TFSA/RRSP, I FEEL RBC AND TD ARE BOTH SOLID BANKS. TD HAS PRETTY DECENT CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND YOU GAIN ACCESS TO THINK OR SWIM WHICH IS A GREAT SOLID CHARTING/TRADING PLATFORM. RBC AT LEAST OFFERS PAPER TRADING WHICH IS NICE. CIBC DOES NOT OR AT LEAST I HAVEN'T FOUND IT IF THEY DO IN TFSA/RRSP INVESTOR'S EDGE ACCOUNTS. THEY OFFER THE MOST COMPETITIVE COMMISSION RATES, BUT IF YOU DON'T PLAN ON PUTTING IN A LOT OF TRADES THEN THAT'S SOMEWHAT INCONSEQUENTIAL. THEIR FILLS ARE REALLY GOOD THOUGH, ALWAYS PRETTY CONTENT WITH THE SPEED AND PRICE AT WHICH THEY FILL ORDERS. HOWEVER, THEY'RE SHIT IN THE SENSE THAT THEY DON'T ALLOW STOPS AND LIMITS ON THE SAME EQUITY. FOR EXAMPLE, IF I WANT TOSS A STOP ON BNS @ $70 BUT ALSO PUT IN A LIMIT AT $75 I CAN'T HAVE BOTH OF THOSE ORDERS OPEN AT THE SAME TIME AS IT SAYS THE ""QUANTITY IS UNAVAILABLE"". CIBC'S UI IS ANTIQUATED AF. I DO MOST OF MY TRADING THROUGH IB OR TC2000 BUT I'D PERSONALLY SUGGEST TD BECAUSE FROM MY EXPERIENCE TOS IS ALSO VERY NICE. THERE ARE STIPULATIONS TO GETTING REAL-TIME DATA BUT THOSE ARE CLEARLY OUTLINED ON THEIR SITE :).

A) I THINK IT WOULD BE INCREDIBLY STUPID TO BELIEVE I HAVE BETTER KNOWLEDGE ON MSFT, AAPL OR TD, RBC OVER INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS. YET I DOUBT THE COMBINED PROFESSIONALS HAVE FOUND THE PERFECT PRICE FOR YOUR RANDOM CANADIAN STOCK ON THE TSX NO ONE OUTSIDE OF CANADA HAS EVER HEARD OF.

THE PRICE OF A STOCK/ETF IN THE FUTURE IS IRRELEVANT: THE PRICE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT YOU BOUGHT AND SOLD IS IMPORTANT, PLUS PERHAPS DIVIDENDS (IF ANY).

AAPL IS CURRENTLY ABOUT US$150. I BOUGHT AAPL MANY YEARS AGO AT ABOUT $90, IT WENT UP TO $500 (MY RIMM DIDN'T DO AS WELL); I SOLD. IT WENT UP TO ABOUT $600, THEN THEY DID A 1:6 SPLIT AND IT ""WENT TO"" $100 AGAIN, RISING TO ITS CURRENT $150.

OF COURSE WHEN I HELD IT THERE WERE NO DIVIDENDS, AND THERE ARE NOW. SO EVEN IF A STOCK IS $X, AND IT STAYS AT $X FOR TEN YEARS, IF YOU'RE GETTING DIVIDENDS YOU CAN STILL MAKE MONEY FROM IT.

AS FOR YOUR CANADIAN STOCK CHOICES, YOU FOUND SOME GOOD ONES. BUT FOR YOUR FINANCE SECTOR, BMO AND CM SHOULD HAVE SMALLER POSITIONS AND TD AND RY SHOULD BE YOUR BIGGEST POSITIONS. I MYSELF GO FOR 40% TD, 40% RY, 20% BNS. YOU HAVE TO LOOK FOR DIVIDEND GROWTH OVER YEARS, NOT JUST DIVIDEND YIELD. TD AND RY HAVE THE GREATEST HISTORIC DIVIDEND GROWTH FROM ALL OF THE BANKS, FOLLOWED BY BNS. 

AS FOR UTILITIES STOCK (WHICH YOU SEEM TO PUT WITH THE ENERGY STOCK), YOU'RE MISSING THE BEST 2 (IMHO): FTS AND ACO-X (ACO-X ACTUALLY HOLDS 52% OF CU STOCKS, SO YOU'RE KIND OF EXPOSED TO IT, BUT ACO-X HAS BETTER DIVIDEND GROWTH THAN CU, BUT WITH A SLIGHTLY LOWER DIVIDEND YIELD CURRENTLY).

YOU'RE SERIOUSLY TOO UNDERWEIGHT IN THE TECH SECTOR AND TOO OVERWEIGHT IN THE REAL ESTATE SECTOR. FOR TECH, GO WITH US COMPANIES, THERE ARE SO MANY GOOD ONES. THERE ARE THE FAMOUS ONES LIKE GOOGLE, FACEBOOK, APPLE, MICROSOFT, ETC. AS FOR REAL-ESTATE, I KNOW THEY HAVE HIGH YIELDS AND MONTHLY PAYMENTS, BUT THEY ARE BY FAR THE SECTOR WITH THE SLOWEST DIVIDEND GROWTH. 

PERSONALLY I FIND THE MARKET VERY OVERPRICED CURRENTLY, SO I WOULD WAIT FOR A LITTLE PULLBACK TO ENTER THE MARKET, BUT IT'S REALLY A CASE BY CASE THING. SOME STOCKS CAN BE UNDERVALUED (LIKE THE ENERGY SECTOR IN CANADA, BUT NOT ALL THOSE IN YOUR LIST SINCE SOME OF THEM BELONG IN THE UTILITY SECTOR, WHICH IS OVERPRICED CURRENTLY), OTHERS ARE FAIRLY VALUED (CANADIAN BANK STOCKS), AND SOME ARE CLEARLY OVERVALUED (TECH STOCKS IN THE US). IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT YOUR ENTRY POINT, I WOULD SUGGEST DOING THE COST AVERAGE STRATEGY, MEANING BUYING THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY WORTH OF STOCKS AT A SET INTERVAL (LIKE EVERY MONTH FOR EXAMPLE). THAT WAY, YOU'LL BUY INTO THE HIGHS AND THE LOWS, AVERAGING YOUR COST ON THE LOW SIDE (SINCE WITH THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY YOU'LL BE ABLE TO BUY MORE LOW PRICE STOCKS AND LESS HIGH PRICE STOCKS).",f7xgv6a,t3_dxykxx,1574057072,1574082272.0,/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/dxykxx/what_do_you_think_about_my_portfolio/f7xgv6a/

&AMP;#X200B;

SO IN 2009, YOU WOULD HAVE AVOIDED BUYING SAY APPLE IN YOUR TFSA BECAUSE OF THE WITHHOLDING TAXES?  WITH SPLITS, ITS ONLY MADE ABOUT 1400%.  YOU REALLY THINK THAT MAKES SENSE?  TAXES ARE DUE ON WITHDRAWAL ON RESP AND RRSPS, I GUESS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO USE THOSE EITHER THEN?  CANADIAN LISTED ETFS WILL HAVE WITHHOLDING TAXES ON THEM TOO, ARE THOSE ALSO OUT OF SCOPE?

SERIOUSLY, YOU CAN AVOID WITHHOLDING TAXES LIKE SO:

* IN AN RRSP OR RRIF, US STOCKS AND US LISTED ETFS THAT ONLY OWN US STOCKS WILL NOT HAVE ANY WITHHOLDING
* IN A TAXABLE ACCOUNT, CAN CLAIM THE FOREIGN TAX CREDIT TO CLAW BACK THE WITHHOLDING

&GT; IF I DON’T HOLD THESE IN A REGISTERED ACCOUNT WHAT KIND OF TAXES/FEES WOULD I END UP PAYING IN ADDITION TO CAPITAL GAINS AND DIVIDENDS. I WANT TO HOLD THEM IN USD AND RECEIVE MY DIVIDENDS IN USD TO REINVEST. 

&AMP;#X200B;

THE FOLLOWING TAXATION LEVELS NEED TO BE CONSIDERED:

* IT'S 15% OF THE DISTRIBUTION, IF THE STOCK PAYS 2%, IT'S 15% OF THAT 2% TO THE IRS.  YOUR BROKER WILL TAKE CARE OF THIS.
* THE REST OF THE DISTRIBUTION IS CONSIDERED INCOME, NO MATTER WHAT THE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE DISTRIBUTION IS.  THIS MEANS EVEN RETURN ON CAPITAL (ROC) AND CAPITAL GAIN DISTRIBUTIONS BECOME FOREIGN INCOME.  THIS IS TAXED THE YEAR YOU RECEIVE IT AT YOUR MARGINAL RATE.  THIS MEANS ACB IS UNCHANGED FROM ROC DISTRIBUTIONS ON FOREIGN SECURITIES.
* US DOLLARS ARE CAPITAL PROPERTY.  CAPITAL GAINS/LOSSES ARE APPLICABLE WHENEVER [THEY'RE SOLD](HTTPS://WWW.ADJUSTEDCOSTBASE.CA/BLOG/CALCULATING-ADJUSTED-COST-BASE-WITH-FOREIGN-CURRENCY-TRANSACTIONS/).
* WHEN SELLING THE STOCKS, CAN REPORT CAPITAL GAINS AND LOSSES ON THEM.  MUST ALWAYS BE REPORTED IN CANADIAN DOLLARS.
* IF RECEIVING ROC.  CAN FILE WITH THE IRS THE FOLLOWING YEAR TO GET THE MONEY WITHHELD BACK.  IT'S STILL FOREIGN INCOME IN CANADA THOUGH, ROC DOLLARS RETRIEVED FROM THE IRS WILL STILL BE TAXED AT YOUR MARGINAL RATE.

I HAVE BEEN ALL CASH SINCE DECEMBER 2017, SOLD OUT ALL OF MY HOLDINGS AND LOCKED IN MY GAINS 

SINCE THEN THIS MONEY HAS BEEN SITTING IN A HISA EARNING 2.75%

THIS IS ABOUT 129K IN CASH

MY REASONING IS THE YIELD CURVE IS INVERTED (3 MONTH AND 5 YEAR ARE INVERTED ALREADY), THE 2-10S INVERTING USUALLY INDICATES A RECESSION WILL HAPPEN WITHIN A FEW MONTHS

RATES ARE GOING UP, WE ARE SEEING RETAILERS CLOSING DOWN

WITH NEAR 0 INTEREST RATES, WE HAVE CREATED A CREDIT BUBBLE (BOTH CONSUMER AND CORPORATE)

I THINK THE SYSTEMIC RISKS THAT WERE THERE BEFORE IN THE 08 COLLAPSE, ARE STILL THERE TODAY JUST IN DIFFERENT FORMS

CREDIT CARD DEBT, CAR LOANS, AND JUNK BONDS 

HTTPS://WWW.BLOOMBERG.COM/OPINION/ARTICLES/2018-07-10/CORPORATE-BONDS-ARE-GETTING-JUNKIER

OF THE 7.5 TRILLION IN US CORPORATE DEBT, ONLY 2.5TRILLION IS HIGH GRADE CORPORATE DEBT, THE REST IS ALL JUNK

THIS IS MOSTLY DUE TO THE FACT THAT BOND INVESTORS (MOSTLY YOUR PENSION FUNDS), TRYING TO GENERATE HIGHER RETURNS IN A LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT (IMAGINE WHEN THESE CORPORATIONS START DEFAULTING ON THEIR JUNK BONDS AND PENSION FUNDS GET SCREWED OVER)

BOTH CREDIT CARD AND CAR LOAN DEBT ARE OVER A TRILLION EACH NOW AND GROWING

SO IF THE AVERAGE CONSUMER IS TAPPED OUT, AND INTEREST PAYMENTS BECOME LARGER, THEIR SPENDING SHOULD DECREASE WHICH SHOULD REFLECT IN THE LUXURY GOODS MARKET FIRST, FOLLOWED BY OTHER MARKETS 

IF WE SEE COMPANIES LIKE APPLE STARTING TO MISS EARNINGS, WE KNOW THE TIME HAS COME

IF I FORM A CANADIAN CORPORATION I WILL BE PAYING 3-4 TIMES THE AMOUNT OF TAXES AS ANY LOCAL BUSINESS IN MY CITY BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT US CITIZENS. THE IRS WILL TAX IT AS A CFC. THEN CANADA WILL TAX THE CORPORATE RATES. THEN ILL BE TAXED A THIRD TIME WHEN I TAKE OUT ANY EARNINGS. THIS IS TAXED 3 TIMES. THE ACCOUNTING FEES FOR A CFC IS AS WELL EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE. ONLY US CITIZENS ARE PUNISHED IN THIS WAY.

THE REPATRIATION TAX ON US EXPATS WITH CFC'S IS ALSO BANKRUPTING MANY US CITIZENS. THERE WAS A ONE TIME TAX ON ALL CASH EARNINGS FROM THE 1980S - 2018 TO PUNISH CORPS LIKE APPLE OR MICROSOFT. SO IF YOU ARE A DOCTOR PRACTICING QUEBEC WITH A CANADIAN CORPORATION AND YOU EARNED 2 MILLION OVER A 20 YEAR CAREER YOU NOW OWE THE IRS $400,000 ON TOP OF THE TAX YOU ALREADY PAID TO THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT.

MONTE SILVER A US EXPAT IS ISRAEL IS FORUMATING A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE US GOVERNMENT FOR THIS. TO BEND OVER TO BEING DOUBLE TAX AND CALLING ME THE ALARMIST IS INSANITY.

196,throw0101a,CanadianInvestor,"&GT; OK, BUT YOU'RE MISSING OUT ON ~HALF THE WORLD EQUITY MARKETS [WITH ONLY S&AMP;P 500].

DEVIL'S ADVOCATE: MAJOR US COMPANIES MAKE ROUGHLY HALF OF THEIR REVENUES INTERNATIONALLY (I.E., NOT-US), SO THEY'RE FAIRLY WELL EXPOSED IN SOME WAYS:

&GT; THE CRUX OF THE CASE FOR NOT WORRYING ABOUT INTERNATIONAL DIVERSIFICATION HAS ALWAYS BEEN THAT THE MULTINATIONALS THAT MAKE UP THE S&AMP;P 500 GENERATE A SIGNIFICATION PORTION OF THEIR REVENUE FROM INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. HOLDING AN S&AMP;P INDEX FUND, WHERE MULTINATIONALS LIKE COCA-COLA OR GOOGLE ARE GENERATING PLENTY OF MONEY FROM INTERNATIONAL SALES, IS A SORT OF SHORTCUT TO INTERNATIONAL DIVERSIFICATION.

205,WookieInHeat,CanadianInvestor,"&GT;APPLE IS MY BIGGEST HOLDING

I'D BE DOWNSIZING OR OUTRIGHT DITCHING APPLE IF I WERE YOU, THEIR BEST DAYS ARE BEHIND THEM.

APPLE'S GROWTH OVER THE LAST DECADE HAS BEEN DRIVEN PRIMARILY - DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY - BY THE IPHONE. WITH THE PROLIFERATION OF CHEAP CHINESE SMARTPHONE BRANDS THAT ARE IMPROVING IN QUALITY BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS EVERY YEAR, THE MAKERS OF PREMIUM FLAGSHIP SMARTPHONES - NAMELY APPLE AND SAMSUNG - HAVE BEGUN STEADILY LOSING MARKET SHARE. THEY CANNOT, NOR WOULD IT MAKE SENSE FOR THEM TO, TRY AND COMPETE WITH THE CHINESE BRANDS ON PRICE; MANY OF WHOM SUBSIDIZE THEIR HANDSET DIVISIONS WITH OTHER AREAS OF THEIR BUSINESS WHILE SELLING PHONES AT A LOSS.

SAMSUNG IS WELL AWARE OF THIS TREND, THEIR BUSINESS PLAN LOOKING INTO THE FUTURE IS EMPHASIZING OTHER AREAS - SEMICONDUCTORS, MANUFACTURING DISPLAY PANELS, ETC. - WHILE SMARTPHONES ARE BARELY A FOOTNOTE. APPLE IS NOT A DIVERSIFIED CORPORATION LIKE SAMSUNG WITH A PRESENCE IN MANY INDUSTRIES, THEIR ENTIRE BUSINESS IS FOCUSED AROUND THEIR SOFTWARE ECOSYSTEM. AS APPLE'S ANNUAL SMARTPHONE SHIPMENTS CONTINUE TO DECLINE OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS, THE ONLY OPTION THEY HAVE FOR CONTINUED REVENUE GROWTH IS INCREASING PRICES - WHICH THEY'VE ALREADY STARTED DOING WITH DRASTIC PRICE INCREASES ACROSS THEIR PRODUCT LINES OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS - THAT WILL FURTHER ACCELERATE THEIR SHRINKING MARKET SHARE.

BARRING ANOTHER REVOLUTIONARY PRODUCT LIKE THE IPHONE, APPLE'S PROSPECTS FOR CONTINUED LONG TERM GROWTH AREN'T LOOKING GREAT. TIM COOK IS A CARETAKER, NOT THE VISIONARY STEVE JOBS WAS.",ed2iiq7,t3_abm04x,1546420727,1546445927.0,/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/abm04x/us_dividend_stocks/ed2iiq7/
