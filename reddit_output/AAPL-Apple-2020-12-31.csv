5,secto10,CanadianInvestor,"GUYS CHECK OUT UGE.V, WHICH IS UGE INTERNATIONAL, A FAST GROWING CANADIAN SOLAR ENERGY COMPANY FOCUSING ON THE U.S MARKET. FROM A FUNDEMANTAL PERSPECTIVE, THE MARKET CAP IS ONLY $48 MILLION CURRENTLY, WHICH IS EXTEREMLY UNDERVALUED. IN ITS LAST QUARTER, UGE ANNOUNCED THEY HAVE A GIANT BACKLOG OF SIGNED PROJECTS WHICH IS $110 MILLION WHICH IS A 200% INCREASE. EVEN MORE IMPRESSIVELY, THESE CONTRACTS ARE SIGNED FOR 20-25 YEARS AND PRODUCE REOCCURRING REVENUE EVERY MONTH FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THIS DURATION. INVESTORS TYPICALLY PAY MUCH HIGHER VALUATIONS FOR REOCCURRING REVENUES, AS EVIDENT BY THE LARGE INCREASE IN AAPL STOCK AFTER THEY FOCUSED ON THEIR REOCCURRING SERVICES SIDE OF THE BUSINESS. ALSO, AFTER ADOPTING A REOCCURRING REVENUE MODEL THEIR GROSS MARGINS INCREASED TO A VERY IMPRESSIVE 48%. THEIR GROWTH WILL CONTINUE TO GROW EFFORTLESSLY AND EXPONENTIALLY AS BUSINESSES WILL IMMEDIATELY REDUCE THEIR COST OF ENERGY AT NO UPFRONT COST TO THEM, A PROPOSITION BUSINESSES CANNOT IGNORE. FINALLY, I BELIEVE THE STOCK IS READY TO EXPLODE DUE TO THE TIGHT CAPITAL STRUCTURE – JUST 26.6 MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING, WITH MORE THAN 50% OF THOSE BEING HELD BY INSIDERS. IF THAT'S NOT ENOUGH, ONE OF THE BIGGEST ADVOCATES AND SHAREHOLDERS OF THIS STOCK IS THE ROBERT MCWHIRTER WHO IS WELL KNOWN FOR FINDING SMALL CAPS WITH LARGE FUTURE GROWTH. HE HAS BOUGHT INTO EVERY FINANCING ROUND AND HAS MANAGED OVER $2.3 BILLION IN HIS FUNDS. LET'S ALSO NOT FORGET THAT BIDEN PLEDGED TO SPEND $2 TRILLION DOLLARS ON RENEWABLE ENERGY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WILL DIRECTLY BENEFIT UGE. 

FROM A TECHNICAL PERSPECTIVE, IT IS EVEN MORE BULLISH. THE STOCK IS CURRENTLY IN A BULL FLAG PATTERN ON THE DAILY CHART AND IS READY TO EXPLODE. A CONTINUATION OF THIS MOVE WILL SEND IT TO $3.4 WITHIN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS, AN ALMOST 100% GAIN. ON A LONGER TERM PERSPECTIVE IT IS ABOVE ALL THE MAJOR MOVING AVERAGES ON THE WEEKLY CHART WHICH SHOULD CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SUBSTANTIAL DYNAMIC SUPPORT AS THE STOCK CONTINUES TO EXPLODE.

* 20%: RIO.UN.TO. SORT OF A HIGHER-RISK PORTION, AIMING AT 100-150% RETURN FOR THE COMING 5 YEARS. JUST TOOK ADVANTAGE OF THE RECENT PRICE DROP DUE TO COVID, WITH DIVIDEND SET TO REINVEST FOR MORE SHARES (OF COURSE, THIS IS PUT IN TFSA).
* 15%: STILL IN ZSP.TO. I WILL BASICALLY CONTINUE MAKING MONTHLY PURCHASES JUST AS A REGULAR SAVING. WHEN THE SAVING BECOMES SIZABLE, I WILL NORBERT IT AND BUY MORE US TECH STOCKS.
* 5%: A LITTLE CASH, ALSO SOME YOLO BETS JUST FOR THE FUN OF IT (E.G. SOME CALL OPTIONS EXPIRING IN 1-2 YEARS). MY BELIEF IS THAT YOLO BETS ARE AT LEAST BETTER THAN WASTING MONEY ON LOTTERY TICKETS. STILL, THE ABSOLUTE VALUE OF YOLO IS LIMITED BELOW $2000 (BUT I DO ENJOY R/WALLSTREETBETS).

OVERALL, I'D SAY IT'S SLIGHTLY ON THE AGGRESSIVE SIDE, BUT THE PORTFOLIO SUITS MY RISK-RETURN APPETITE AND OBJECTIVES. OTHER THAN THE TECH INDUSTRY, I FIND IT VERY CONSUMING (TIME AND MENTALLY) TO PICK INDIVIDUAL STOCKS, AND THE RETURN MIGHT STILL BE WORSE THAN SIMPLY BUYING A MARKET ETF.

EDIT (ADDED): I THINK MINE IS PRETTY SIMILAR TO OP, EXCEPT THE ESPORTS PART (I AM CURIOUS ABOUT HOW MUCH IT WOULD RETURN, WILL KEEP AN EYE ON IT).",g4ukv1n,t3_iqu7cp,1599849039,1599874239.0,/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/iqu7cp/seeking_advice_equity_diversification_by_sector/g4ukv1n/

130,ggty5,CanadianInvestor,"&GT;WE KNOW ABOUT THE 15% WITHHOLDING ON GAINS IN HER TFSA BUT IS IT PER TRADE OR ON A YEARLY BASIS? FOR EXAMPLE IF SHE HAD SOME TRADES THAT WERE LOSES DO THEY COUNT AGAINST HER GAINS ON TRADES? 

THE 15% WITHHOLDING IS ONLY ON DIVIDENDS, NOT GAINS. 

&GT;FREE TRADES BUT HAS A 1.5% CURRENCY CONVERSION RATE. IS THIS A FEE LEVIED PER TRADE? FOR EXAMPLE, BOUGHT 1000 DOLLARS OF AAPL SO SHE’S LEVIED 1.5% WHEN SHE BUYS. IF SHE SELL, DOES IT CHARGE HER 1.5% AGAIN TO BE CONVERTED BACK TO CAD OR DOES IT HOLD IT IN USD IF SHE WANTED TO TRADE AGAIN SO SHE DON’T HAVE TO CONVERT BACK TO USD?

WEALTHSIMPLE ONLY ALLOWS CAD DENOMINATED ACCOUNTS, SO THE CONVERSION FEE WOULD APPLY TO BOTH BUYS AND SELLS.

&GT;OR SHE CAN HAVE DELAYED DATA AND JUST USE A DIFFERENT PLATFORM TO SEE THE BID/ASK SPREAD.

MARKET DATA IS PRETTY CHEAP AT IB, SO THAT'S AN OPTION AS WELL. NOT REALLY NECESSARY FOR INVESTING, BUT WORTHWHILE IF TRADING. NOTE THAT THE CRA DOES NOT ALLOW ACTIVE TRADING IN TFSAS, ALTHOUGH THEY GENERALLY DON'T ENFORCE THIS UNLESS YOU START MAKING SERIOUS GAINS. SOMETHING TOO KEEP IN MIND, HOWEVER. 

&GT; I’M NOT SURE HOW THE CONVERSION FEES WORKS OUT BUT WAS WONDERING WHAT THOSE ARE

IB IS BY FAR THE BEST FOR FOREIGN CONVERSION. SPOT RATE FOR A FIXED FEE OF JUST A FEW BUCKS.

&GT;G WHAT THOSE ARE. ALSO, NOTICED THERE’S A 12.50 QUARTERLY FEE FOR AN RRSP. SO 50 DOLLARS A YEAR JUST TO HAVE A RRSP WITH DELAYED DATA. 

&GT;IF SHE DOES GET INTO OPTIONS IT WOULD MAINLY BE SELLING COVERED CALLS AND PUTS.

COVERED CALLS ARE FINE, BUT PUTS CANNOT BE SOLD IN A TFSA OR AN RRSP, EVEN IF CASH-SECURED. SHE'LL NEED A NON-REGISTERED MARGIN ACCOUNT FOR THAT.",g2o2ltq,t3_ifj7m4,1598251719,1598276919.0,/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/ifj7m4/help_choosing_a_broker/g2o2ltq/

REDDIT ISN'T EXACTLY THE BEST WAY TO NAVIGATE A LARGE SUM OF MONEY AS THEY WILL GIVE YOU MANY OPINIONS. ILL LIST 3 MAIN WAYS AND A FUN 4TH WAY TO GREATLY INCREASE YOUR WEALTH. 

1. TFSA  - MAX IT TO 69K. PUT THEM INTO CDN BANKS, HIGH DIVIDEND LIKE CANADIAN RAIL ROAD, OIL AND GAS, SOME BREAK OUT TECH LSPD, SEMICONDUCTORS - SEE WWW.FINVIZ.COM CLICK ON THE HEATMAP FOR AN IDEA OF DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES. I AGREE INVESTING IT YOURSELF IS BETTER THAN PAYING SOMEONE TO DO IT. ALSO OPEN US TFSA ACCOUNT. AVOID WEALTH SIMPLE OR WEALTH TRADE BECAUSE THEY CANNOT KEEP USD CURRENCIES IN US DENOMINATION AFTER THE SALE COSTING YOU 1.5% PER TRANSACTION, WHICH IS LIKE WORSE THAN A FINANCIAL ADVISOR. 

2. RRSP - HERE YOU WILL MOST LIKELY BE ABLE TO PUT IN ANOTHER 50K OR SO. THE ADVANTAGE HERE ARE USA DIVIDENDS HAVE NO WITHOLDING TAX. SO I SUGGEST OPENING BOTH US AND CDN CURRENCY IN HERE. BUY US STOCKS THAT GIVE DIVIDENDS FOR EXAMPLE JPM, BAC, MICROSOFT, AAPL, NOW GO SLOW HERE AS MICROSOFT AND AAPL RECENTLY HAVE BLASTED OFF SO ADD IN SLOWLY. 

3. FINALLY YOU WILL HAVE MORE THAN 250K LEFT TO UTILIZE. I SUGGEST YOU OPEN BOTH US AND CDN CASH ACCOUNT. IN THE BEGINNING YOU CAN PUT SOME INTO A SAVINGS ACCOUNT UNTIL YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO BUY. YOU WILL NEED TO PAY TAXES ON YOUR INCOME WHEN YOU SELL  HERE UNFORTUNATELY SO KEEP THAT IN MIND. 

4. LEAVE 20K TO BE USED TO OPEN BANK ACCOUNTS THAT GIVE $500 PROMOTION OR MORE FOR OPENING A BANK ACCOUNT WITH THEM. LEAVE 6 ISH K IN EACH OF THEM AND THEY WAIVE A $120 CREDIT CARD EACH YEAR. DO BANK ACCOUNT/ CREDIT CARD CHURNING TO MAKE ANOTHER 20K IN POINTS VALUE EACH YEAR. YOU MAY THINK WHY DO ALL THE HASSLE DESPITE HAVING SO MUCH MONEY. THEN YOU WILL REALIZE IT'S BECAUSE YOU HAVE SO MUCH MONEY THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO CHURN BANK ACCOUNTS AND CREDIT CARDS. YOU HAVE ENTERED A NEW OPPORTUNITY ! BANK ACCOUNTS ARE AROUND 5% RETURN INVESTMENT  AND CREDIT CARDS ARE MORE THAN 10% RETURN ON SPENDING.

164,nobodynobody567,CanadianInvestor,"REDDIT ISN'T EXACTLY THE BEST WAY TO NAVIGATE A LARGE SUM OF MONEY AS THEY WILL GIVE YOU MANY OPINIONS. ILL LIST 3 MAIN WAYS AND A FUN 4TH WAY TO GREATLY INCREASE YOUR WEALTH. 

1. TFSA  - MAX IT TO 69K. PUT THEM INTO CDN BANKS, HIGH DIVIDEND LIKE CANADIAN RAIL ROAD, OIL AND GAS, SOME BREAK OUT TECH LSPD, SEMICONDUCTORS - SEE WWW.FINVIZ.COM CLICK ON THE HEATMAP FOR AN IDEA OF DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES. I AGREE INVESTING IT YOURSELF IS BETTER THAN PAYING SOMEONE TO DO IT. ALSO OPEN US TFSA ACCOUNT. AVOID WEALTH SIMPLE OR WEALTH TRADE BECAUSE THEY CANNOT KEEP USD CURRENCIES IN US DENOMINATION AFTER THE SALE COSTING YOU 1.5% PER TRANSACTION, WHICH IS LIKE WORSE THAN A FINANCIAL ADVISOR. 

2. RRSP - HERE YOU WILL MOST LIKELY BE ABLE TO PUT IN ANOTHER 50K OR SO. THE ADVANTAGE HERE ARE USA DIVIDENDS HAVE NO WITHOLDING TAX. SO I SUGGEST OPENING BOTH US AND CDN CURRENCY IN HERE. BUY US STOCKS THAT GIVE DIVIDENDS FOR EXAMPLE JPM, BAC, MICROSOFT, AAPL, NOW GO SLOW HERE AS MICROSOFT AND AAPL RECENTLY HAVE BLASTED OFF SO ADD IN SLOWLY. 

3. FINALLY YOU WILL HAVE MORE THAN 250K LEFT TO UTILIZE. I SUGGEST YOU OPEN BOTH US AND CDN CASH ACCOUNT. IN THE BEGINNING YOU CAN PUT SOME INTO A SAVINGS ACCOUNT UNTIL YOU KNOW WHAT YOU WANT TO BUY. YOU WILL NEED TO PAY TAXES ON YOUR INCOME WHEN YOU SELL  HERE UNFORTUNATELY SO KEEP THAT IN MIND. 

4. LEAVE 20K TO BE USED TO OPEN BANK ACCOUNTS THAT GIVE $500 PROMOTION OR MORE FOR OPENING A BANK ACCOUNT WITH THEM. LEAVE 6 ISH K IN EACH OF THEM AND THEY WAIVE A $120 CREDIT CARD EACH YEAR. DO BANK ACCOUNT/ CREDIT CARD CHURNING TO MAKE ANOTHER 20K IN POINTS VALUE EACH YEAR. YOU MAY THINK WHY DO ALL THE HASSLE DESPITE HAVING SO MUCH MONEY. THEN YOU WILL REALIZE IT'S BECAUSE YOU HAVE SO MUCH MONEY THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO CHURN BANK ACCOUNTS AND CREDIT CARDS. YOU HAVE ENTERED A NEW OPPORTUNITY ! BANK ACCOUNTS ARE AROUND 5% RETURN INVESTMENT  AND CREDIT CARDS ARE MORE THAN 10% RETURN ON SPENDING. 

FEEL FREE TO CONTACT ME TO LET ME KNOW HOW IT GOES ! BE CAREFUL WITH YOUR MONEY. YOU HAVE ENOUGH TO RETIRE ON IF YOU KEEP WORKING.

2. CAPITAL GAINS. 

THIS IS FROM PROFITING FROM SHARE PRICE APPRECIATION. IF YOU HOLD THE SHARES IN TFSA, YOU DON’T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THIS AT ALL. IF YOU ARE NOT US TAX RESIDENTS, THEN NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. 

3. STOCK SPLITS.

THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE WITHHOLDING TAXES OR CAPITAL GAINS WHATSOEVER, ALL WHAT THIS DOES IS APPLE DECIDES TO MAKE THE CURRENT ONE SHARE AAPL INTO 4 AAPL. THIS ISN’T DIVIDEND.

KEEP IN MIND THESE ARE SOME OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL TECH COMPANIES IN THE WORLD, AND THEY ARE NOT IN HYPER GROWTH MODE. THAT PLAYS A ROLE, SO LET'S JUST SAY OUR AIM FOR SHOPIFY IS P/E 50, SOUNDS REASONABLE, RIGHT? 

10% NET PROFIT MARGIN FOR A SAAS COMPANY? THAT'S A LITTLE LOW DON'T YOU THINK? TRY 25-35% AND NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU GET SOMETHING MORE REALISTIC. FOR EXAMPLE IF YOU LOOK AT SHOPIFY'S ANNUAL REPORT, NOTICE A FEW THINGS:

- THEIR OPERATING CASH FLOW IS ACTUALLY POSITIVE

- MOST OF THE CASH LOST IS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITES (THAT HYPER GROWTH ISN'T FREE) 

- BASICALLY NO DEBT

SAY SHOPIFY'S REVENUE GROWS 30% ANNUALIZED FOR THE NEXT 5 YEARS. THAT'S 1.58 (2019 REVENUE) X 1.3^5 ~ 5.86B 
LET'S SAY THEIR NET PROFIT MARGIN IS 30%. THAT'S 5.86*0.3 ~ 1.758
NOW 90 / 1.758 IS 51. THAT'S OUR AIMED P/E, RIGHT? I DIDN'T EVEN USE THE MOST OPTIMISTIC NUMBERS, AND YOU CAN SURE AS HELL BET THAT SHOPIFY WILL HAVE EVEN MORE MONEY TO INVEST NOW THAT THEY ANNOUNCED THEY ARE GOING TO SWITCH TO REMOTE WORK, THOSE OFFICES AND PERKS AREN'T FREE, MEANING EVEN MORE CASH TO INVEST. 

THEY ALSO HAVE A _LOT_ OF THINGS IN THE PIPELINE, IF YOU READ THEIR ANNUAL REPORT, EVENTUALLY AS THEIR FULFILLMENT NETWORK STARTS BECOMING LARGER, THIS WILL AMPLIFY THEIR MERCHANTS EARNINGS AND CONSEQUENTLY THEIR OWN EARNING AND ATTRACT MORE BIG BUSINESSES, AS THEIR POS GROWS EVEN MORE, THEIR ONLINE STORE BECOMING A LOT BETTER, SHOPIFY AS A WHOLE IS WORTH WAY MORE THAN THE SUM OF ITS PARTS, BUT THE WAY I SEE IT, THE NUMBERS DON'T LOOK AT ALL THAT UNREALISTIC, THE QUESTION TO ASK IS, CAN THEY ACTUALLY MATERIALIZE EVERYTHING THAT'S PRICED IN AT THE MOMENT.

256,catsaysmrau,CanadianInvestor,"YOUR DEFINITION OF ""CHEAP"" IS MISGUIDED. SAY IT WITH ME: SHARE PRICE **WHEN COMPARING DIFFERENT SECURITIES** IS IRRELEVANT.

SIMPLE MATH:

100 SHARES AT $10, GOES UP BY 10%, HOW MUCH DID YOU GAIN?

10 SHARES AT $100, GOES UP BY 10%, HOW MUCH DID YOU GAIN?


COMPARING COMPANIES BASED ON SHARE PRICE IS TRULY APPLES AND ORANGES. EVERYBODY'S PIE IS CUT INTO DIFFERENT SIZED PIECES, WHILE EVERY PIE IS A DIFFERENT SIZE AND FLAVOUR. AAPL IS WORTH APPROXIMATELY $200B MORE THAN AMZN OVERALL, SO WHY ARE THEIR SHARES PRICES $314.45 AND $2383.33 RESPECTIVELY? DOES THAT MEAN AMAZON IS WORTH 6.58 TIMES WHAT APPLE IS? OF COURSE NOT.

258,catsaysmrau,CanadianInvestor,"TFSA: **TAX FREE** SAVINGS ACCOUNT. CAPITAL GAINS TAXES DO NOT APPLY, PERIOD. HOWEVER THE DOUBLE EDGE TO THAT SWORD IS THAT CAPITAL LOSSES CANNOT BE DEDUCTED. LOSS OF CONTRIBUTION ROOM IS PERMANENT, MEANING YOU CONTRIBUTE $5000 BUY A STOCK, STOCK HYPOTHETICALLY GOES TO $0 AND YOU LOSE EVERYTHING... CONTRIBUTION ROOM DOESN'T COME BACK. YEAH YOU DO GET MORE IN JANUARY, BUT THAT IS NEW ROOM, NOT A RETURN OF WHAT YOU LOST. BUT IN GENERAL IT'S TOTALLY FINE TO HOLD US STOCKS IN A TFSA, IT'S ALSO FINE TO HOLD US STOCKS THAT PAY A DIVIDEND, IT'S ONLY A SUGGESTION FOR OPTIMIZATION NOT A STEADFAST RULE. DO THE MATH WITH THE SPECIFIC HOLDINGS. HOW MUCH IS THE ANNUAL YIELD? WHAT IS 15% OF THAT? THAT'S WHAT THE US WITHHOLDS. HYPOTHETICALLY 100 SHARES OF AAPL ($31,889 USD) WOULD YIELD $328.46 ANNUALLY, 15% OF THAT IS $49.27.... THAT'S WHAT UNCLE SAM WOULD KEEP IF YOU HAD IT IN A TFSA. BUT THE EQUITY GROWTH WOULD HAVE ZERO CAPITAL GAINS TAX IF WERE TO SELL... AND LETS FACE IT, WHO IS REALLY BUYING AAPL FOR THE DIVIDEND?


BE THOUGHTFUL WITH RRSP'S BECAUSE HOW YOU USE IT GREATLY DEPENDS ON YOUR SPECIFIC PERSONAL FINANCIAL SITUATION. WHILE CAPITAL GAINS ARE NOT IMMEDIATELY TAXABLE WITHIN AN RSP, THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY AREN'T TAXED... IN A WAY. RSP CONTRIBUTIONS SHOULD BE RESERVED FOR WHEN YOU AT YOUR HIGHEST INCOME POTENTIAL, IN ORDER TO DEFER THE CORRESPONDING INCOME TAX VIA THE TAX CREDIT, AND THEN PAY THE INCOME TAX ON WITHDRAWALS ONCE YOU RETIRE AND HYPOTHETICALLY ARE IN A SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER TAX BRACKET. INVESTING VIA AN RRSP WOULD ALSO LIMIT YOUR ACCESS TO THE MONEY. [BECAUSE YOU RECEIVE A TAX CREDIT WHEN YOU CONTRIBUTE, TURNING AROUND AND WITHDRAWING IS A TAXABLE EVENT.](HTTPS://WWW.CANADA.CA/EN/REVENUE-AGENCY/SERVICES/TAX/INDIVIDUALS/TOPICS/RRSPS-RELATED-PLANS/MAKING-WITHDRAWALS/TAX-RATES-ON-WITHDRAWALS.HTML) THERE ARE A FEW INSTANCES WHERE WITHDRAWALS CAN BE TAX FREE, BUT THEY HAVE THEIR OWN STIPULATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE THE [HOME BUYERS PLAN](HTTPS://WWW.CANADA.CA/EN/REVENUE-AGENCY/SERVICES/TAX/INDIVIDUALS/TOPICS/RRSPS-RELATED-PLANS/WHAT-HOME-BUYERS-PLAN.HTML) WHICH ALLOWS YOU TO TAKE OUT $35K WITH NOW TAX PENALTY, SO LONG AS YOU RE-CONTRIBUTE THAT AMOUNT WITHIN 15 YEARS. SIMILAR ONE EXISTS FOR TUITION.


IT'S TRUE THAT DIVIDENDS FROM US STOCKS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO WITHHOLDING TAX, BECAUSE THE US GOVERNMENT RECOGNIZES IT AS A PROPER REGISTERED ACCOUNT. THE TFSA HOWEVER, THEY DON'T, THAT'S WHY IT APPLIES. LIKELY BECAUSE THERE IS NO AMERICAN EQUIVALENT. BUT TO SUM UP, IF IT MAKES SENSE FOR YOU, SURE HOLD AMERICAN STOCKS IN A TFSA. IF IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR WHATEVER REASON, DON'T.

I'VE BEEN PRETTY HEAVILY RESEARCHING SINCE JANUARY, AND THE US IS THE WAY TO GO, ALTHOUGH DIVERSIFICATION IS GOOD TOO. THERE SIMPLY AREN'T MANY GOOD OPTIONS IN CANADA, RELATIVE TO THE US; THEIR ECONOMY IS MUCH MORE DIVERSIFIED AND BUSINESS FRIENDLY. THE MAIN DISADVANTAGE IS THE EXCHANGE RATE AND WITHOLDING TAXES ON AMERICAN DIVIDENDS. YOU CAN EITHER HOLD YOUR AMERICAN DIVIDEND PAYERS IN AN RRSP, TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE TAX TREATY (AMERICAN DIVIDENDS ARE TAXED 15%, BUT IN THE AN RRSP ARE EXEMPT), OR YOU CAN BUY NON-DIVIDEND STOCKS, OR JUST SUCK UP THE SMALL LOSS AND HOLD THE DIVIDEND PAYERS IN YOUR TFSA.

DIVIDEND STOCKS PAY YOU OUT, WHAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO ASSUME TO BE, A SAFE STREAM OF INCOME EVERY QUARTER (OR MONTH). BUT THAT DIVIDEND HAS TO COME FROM SOMEWHERE. IF A STOCK IS $100/SH, AND PAYS OUT A $1 DIVIDEND, IT IS IMMEDIATELY WORTH $99 EX DIVIDEND. IF THE COMPANY ONLY HAD 1 SHARE OF $100, THEN IT IS NOW WORTH 1% LESS AS YOU'VE TAKEN THAT 1%. THE QUESTION IS NOW, DO YOU BELIEVE YOU CAN DO BETTER WITH THAT $1 THAN THE COMPANY CAN? CAN YOU REINVEST THAT $1 AND GROW IT MORE THAN THE COMPANY CAN? THE ONE THAT ALREADY HAS THE INFRASTRUCTURE, THE RESOURCES, THE SKILLS, THE KNOW-HOW, AND THE PEOPLE TO GROW THE COMPANY MORE? 

OR DO YOU SAY TO THAT COMPANY? NO, KEEP YOUR MONEY, REINVEST IT IN THE COMPANY BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN MANAGEMENT, AND GROW THAT $1 YOU WOULD HAVE GIVEN TO ME OTHERWISE INTO $1.50. NOW MY SHARES ARE WORTH MORE. ADDITIONALLY, DIVIDENDS IF THEY AREN'T IN YOUR TFSA, WILL TRIGGER TAX. CAPITAL GAINS, WHETHER OR NOT YOU SELL IT ON THE OPEN MARKET OR VIA BUYBACK, IS WHOLLY UP TO YOU WHEN YOU TAKE THAT HIT. AND CAPITAL GAINS ARE TAXED AT A LOWER RATE.

296,catsaysmrau,CanadianInvestor,"THIS SUB HAS A HARD ON FOR MINIMIZING FEES. THAT ISN'T AN INVESTMENT STRATEGY. BE AWARE OF TAX EFFICIENCY, BUT DON'T LET IT DICTATE YOUR STRATEGY.

DIVIDEND WITHHOLDING TAX SOUNDS SCARY BUT IT'S AUTOMATIC, AND HONESTLY NOT CRAZY HIGH. 15% OF DIVIDENDS ARE WITHHELD, SO FOR EXAMPLE AAPL PAYS $0.77 IN QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS RIGHT NOW, AND THAT TAX WOULD AMOUNT TO $0.462 PER SHARE PER YEAR BEING WITHHELD AND NOT PAID TO YOU. WHILE THIS IS NOT A PERFECT EXAMPLE BECAUSE BUYING AAPL ISN'T TYPICALLY FOR THE MINIMAL DIVIDEND YIELD, IT'S A TECH GROWTH STOCK FIRST AND FOREMOST.

RRSP'S ARE RECOGNIZED BY THE US AS A VALID RETIREMENT ACCOUNT, SO DUE TO OUR TAX TREATY THEY DO NOT WITHHOLD ANY PORTION OF DIVIDENDS AS TAX IF THE SECURITIES ARE HELD IN THAT KIND OF ACCOUNT. PLENTY OF PROS AND CONS FOR USING DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS TO INVEST. RRSP'S WHILE POWERFUL, THERE MAY BE SOME REASONS NOT TO USE IT FOR THIS PURPOSE AT THIS TIME IN YOUR LIFE. LIKE EVERYTHING IN INVESTING, THERE IS A GREY AREA AND IT DEPENDS ON THE SPECIFICS OF YOU AND YOUR SITUATION. FIRST CON WOULD BE ACCESS TO CAPITAL. ONCE YOU CONTRIBUTE TO THAT ACCOUNT, ANY WITHDRAWALS ARE TAXABLE INCOME. THIS IS BECAUSE YOU RECEIVE A TAX CREDIT FOR CONTRIBUTIONS. THE IDEA IS CONTRIBUTE DURING YOUR HIGHEST EARNING YEARS, AND YOU DEFER TAXES UNTIL RETIREMENT WHEN YOU'LL IN THEORY BE IN A LOWER TAX BRACKET, THUS SAVING MONEY. THE TAX SAVED DURING HIGHEST INCOME YEARS IS LIKELY MUCH MUCH GREATER THAN ANY PITTANCE OF A DIVIDEND WITHHOLDING TAX THAT WOULD APPLY OTHERWISE IF YOU ARE JUST STARTING OUT (I ASSUME YOU'RE YOUNG) AND HOLDING AMERICAN DIVIDEND PAYERS. SECOND IS THAT THERE IS A LIMIT OF CONTRIBUTION ROOM WHICH IS CALCULATED, INCREASED, AND CARRIED OVER EACH YEAR BASED ON YOUR INCOME. SO HYPOTHETICALLY IF ONE WERE TO HAVE ALREADY MAXED OUT THEIR RRSP WITH INVESTMENTS THEY WANT TO KEEP, AND THEN THEY WANT TO ALSO PURCHASE STOCK IN AN AMERICAN COMPANY THAT PAYS DIVIDENDS. SHOULD THEY NOT DO IT BECAUSE OF THE SCARY TAX? OF COURSE NOT. THIRD CON IS JUST A CON IN GENERAL ABOUT THE RRSP, NOT NECESSARILY PERTAINING TO DIVIDENDS. THERE IS NO TAX LOSS HARVESTING IN RRSP'S, OR TFSA'S FOR THAT MATTER, SO ACTIVELY TRYING TO TRADE IN AN RRSP ISN'T EXACTLY THAT SMART, IT'S MORE APPROPRIATE TO LONG LONG TERM STRATEGIES. IT IS A RETIREMENT ACCOUNT AFTER ALL.

WELL DIVERSIFIED AGAIN (GLOBALLY)  BUT WITHOUT BONDS.

THIS IS WHY STRICTER, RULES-BASED INVESTING (STICKING TO INDEXES OR WELL-DIVERSIFIED FUNDS, DOLLAR-COST AVERAGING, REBALANCING AT REGULAR INTERVALS) OFTEN WORKS BETTER FOR PEOPLE THAN TRYING TO BUY INDIVIDUAL STOCKS AND TRYING TO TIME THE MARKET.

BUT ONLY BECAUSE WE’VE MADE IT THAT WAY, ENERGY EAST PIPELINE TO OUR REFINERIES OUT IN THE EAST WOULD BE A GREAT START, STOP SELLING OUR OIL TO THE US FOR A DIME TO BUY IT BACK FOR A DOLLAR.  

SECONDLY NO I DON’T THINK ANOTHER TAX IS THE ANSWER. I FEEL CANADIAN CITIZENS HAVE BEEN PAYING ENOUGH FOR THE GOVERNMENTS CARELESS SPENDING AND I PERSONALLY BELIEVE A CARBON TAX DOESN’T MAKE ME WANNA BE GREENER  IT JUST MAKES ME DISAPPOINTED THAT THE ONLY THING GOVERNMENTS WANT TO DO IS TAX THE SHUT OUT OF US HARD WORKING CANADIANS BECAUSE THEY CAN’T ALLOCATE TIME OR MONEY INTO MORE BIG BRAIN IDEAS.

HOWEVER I DON’T THINK IT SHOULD BE LOWERED TO THE POINT WHERE IT’S HIGHWAY ROBBERY FOR THE CORPORATIONS. 

TO ANSWER YOUR OTHER QUESTION, I DRIVE A NEWER (2018) ECODIESEL, GET THE BEST DAMN MILEAGE I’VE SEEN A HALF-TONNE TRUCK GET. IF THERE WAS AN ELECTRIC PICKUP AVAILABLE THAT COULD SURVIVE CANADIAN WINTERS, GET LONG DISTANCE (800-1000KM) PER CHARGE I’D BUY IT IN A HEARTBEAT BECAUSE I BELIEVE ELECTRIC VEHICLES AT LEAST FOR MY PURPOSES WOULD BE BENEFICIAL. 

OTHER POLICIES WOULD BE TO BAN ONE USE PLASTICS (ALREADY BEING DONE ACROSS CANADA), CREATE A POLICY TO FIGHT AGAINST COMPANIES LIKE APPLE AND SAMSUNG TO GIVE THE RIGHT TO REPAIR OUR DEVICES SO THERE ISN’T A CONSTANT NEED TO UPGRADE PHONES. I’D MADE A POLICY REGARDING HOME RENOVATION THAT GIVES STRONGER INCENTIVE TO USE MORE ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY MATERIALS AND SOLAR PANELS. MAKE IT MORE REASONABLE TO HAVE SOLAR PANELS DESIGNED FOR CANADIAN WINTERS TO BE AVAILABLE TO ANYONE WILLING TO STEP UP. 

I THINK IT WOULD BE SUICIDE TO COMPLETELY BE A BULLISH ECONOMY ON THE GREEN FRONT, OIL WILL STILL BE AROUND FOR A LONG TIME, WHY NOT USE THE BEST OIL IN THE WORLD BOTH ENVIRONMENTALLY AND HUMANELY TO SUPPLY OUR NEEDS AND TO SUPPLY ENOUGH JOBS AND PROFIT IN OUR ECONOMY TO ADVANCE OUR KNOWLEDGE OF GREEN TECH AND CREATE LOWER PRICES FOR ALL THE TAKE ADVANTAGE OF.

VERY AS OF NOW HAS A HIGHER PROFIT MARGIN COMPARED TO BYND (42% VS 27.9%) , HAS INCREASED REVENUE BY 400% YEAR OVER YEAR, AND CELEBRITY ENDORSEMENT (PROBABLY THE BIGGEST THING YOU NEED TO BECOME A HOUSEHOLD NAME).

438,manuce94,CanadianInvestor," IF YOU HAVING PAYWALL ISSUE HERE IS THE NEWS.

CANADA’S BIGGEST PATENT HOLDER, BLACKBERRY LTD., IS LOOKING TO UNLOAD MOST OF ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN A DEAL THAT COULD MARK ANOTHER TURNING POINT FOR THE FALLEN FORMER SMARTPHONE GIANT.

BUT IT COULD ALSO DEAL A MAJOR SETBACK TO OTTAWA’S INNOVATION STRATEGY EFFORTS, MARKING THE SECOND TIME IN A DECADE THAT VALUABLE IP ASSETS FROM ONE OF CANADA’S LEADING RESEARCH-AND-DEVELOPMENT-DRIVEN COMPANIES HAVE BEEN SOLD OFF. IF, AS EXPECTED, A DEAL RESULTS IN OWNERSHIP OF TENS OF THOUSANDS OF BLACKBERRY PATENTS PASSING INTO FOREIGN HANDS, TAXPAYER-FUNDED ASSETS POTENTIALLY WORTH HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS COULD LEAVE THE COUNTRY ALONG WITH PROSPECTS OF GENERATING ANY FURTHER BENEFIT TO THE ECONOMY.

THE GLOBE AND MAIL HAS CONFIRMED [A REPORT LAST WEEK](HTTPS://WWW.IAM-MEDIA.COM/MARKET-DEVELOPMENTS/EXCLUSIVE-BLACKBERRY-EYES-POSSIBLE-PATENT-PORTFOLIO-SALE) BY IP INDUSTRY JOURNAL IAM THAT 

[BB-T](HTTPS://WWW.THEGLOBEANDMAIL.COM/INVESTING/MARKETS/STOCKS/BB-T) \+2.06%INCREASE RECENTLY BEGAN SHOPPING THE MAJORITY OF ITS 38,000 PATENTS TO INTERESTED PARTIES. TECH+IP CAPITAL, LLC, A U.S. INVESTMENT BANKING FIRM, IS HANDLING THE SALE FOR BLACKBERRY.

A SOURCE FAMILIAR WITH THE SITUATION TOLD THE GLOBE THE COMPANY ISN’T CERTAIN WHAT PRICE IT WILL GET, BUT IT’S BELIEVED THE PORTFOLIO COULD BE WORTH MORE THAN US$450-MILLION - A SIGNIFICANT SIZE FOR A DEAL IN THE GLOBAL PATENT TRADE, BUT A FRACTION OF THE US$4.5-BILLION A CONSORTIUM LED BY APPLE INC. APPLE INC. PAID IN 2011 FOR A TROVE OF 6,000 NORTEL NETWORKS PATENTS. THE GLOBE IS NOT IDENTIFYING THE SOURCE AS THEY ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO SPEAK PUBLICLY ON THE MATTER.

A BLACKBERRY SPOKESMAN DECLINED COMMENT, SAYING THE WATERLOO, ONT. COMPANY “DOES NOT COMMENT ON RUMOUR OR SPECULATION.”

THE PATENTS UP FOR SALE INCLUDE IP IN AREAS WHERE BLACKBERRY WAS A TRAILBLAZER BUT IS NO LONGER A PLAYER, SUCH AS MOBILE INSTANT MESSAGING AND SOCIAL COLLABORATION TOOLS. THE COMPANY HAS SEVERAL THOUSAND MORE PATENTS IT IS EXPECTED TO KEEP BECAUSE THEY UNDERLIE ITS CURRENT BUSINESSES, WHICH INCLUDE CYBERSECURITY AND BUILDING COMPUTER OPERATING SYSTEMS FOR CARS,

CEO JOHN CHEN, WHO HAS BEEN TRYING TO TURN BLACKBERRY AROUND SINCE HE WAS APPOINTED IN NOVEMBER, 2013, HAS BEEN MANAGING THE EXIT OF THE COMPANY FROM THE SMARTPHONE BUSINESS, CUTTING COSTS AND SHIFTING INTO NEW SOFTWARE BUSINESSES. BUT THE COMPANY’S SHARE PRICE HAS BEEN VOLATILE, AND SITS AT US$5.29 ON THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE AFTER HITTING A HIGH OF MORE THAN DOUBLE THAT IN EARLY 2018.

ONE CONSISTENT BRIGHT SPOT HAS BEEN THE COMPANY’S ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUES AND PROFITS FROM ITS PATENTS BY PURSUING LICENSING DEALS WITH OTHER FIRMS, TYPICALLY BY NEGOTIATING WITH COMPANIES IT MAINTAINED WERE USING ITS IP, OR BY SUING COMPANIES SUCH AS FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND SNAP IT SAID OWED THE COMPANY FOR THE PRIVILEGE.

BLACKBERRY’S PATENT PORTFOLIO IS “LARGE, DIVERSE AND DEEP, MEANING THAT IN THE HANDS OF A SAVVY OWNER, IT IS EXTREMELY VALUABLE,” SAID WATERLOO-BASED IP LAWYER JIM HINTON.

BLACKBERRY HAS GENERATED A BOUNTY OF REVENUES AND PROFITS IN RECENT YEARS FROM ITS PATENTS BY PURSUING LICENSING DEALS WITH OTHER FIRMS – TYPICALLY BY NEGOTIATING WITH COMPANIES IT MAINTAINED WERE USING ITS IP, OR BY SUING COMPANIES SUCH AS FACEBOOK, TWITTER AND SNAP IT SAID OWED THE COMPANY FOR THE PRIVILEGE.

BLACKBERRY GENERATED US$328-MILLION IN “LICENSING AND OTHER” REVENUE LAST YEAR – OVER 31 PER CENT OF TOTAL SALES – AND US$1.1-BILLION OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS. THE LICENSING BUSINESS HAS REMAINED ONE OF THE FEW BRIGHT SPOTS FOR THE BUSINESS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, ALTHOUGH THE INCONSISTENCY AND UNPREDICTABILITY OF LICENSING DEALS MEAN THE BUSINESS ISN’T FULLY VALUED BY PUBLIC SHAREHOLDERS.

""LICENSING AND OTHER” REVENUE [IN THE COMPANY’S SECOND QUARTER ENDED AUG. 31](HTTPS://WWW.THEGLOBEANDMAIL.COM/BUSINESS/TECHNOLOGY/ARTICLE-BLACKBERRY-TOPS-FORECASTS-BUT-STRUGGLES-TO-GROW-SOFTWARE-SERVICES/) AMOUNTED TO US$108-MILLION – 42 PER CENT OF BLACKBERRY’S TOTAL AND WELL AHEAD OF EXPECTATIONS – AND HELPED IT DELIVER A STRONGER-THAN-EXPECTED PROFIT OF US11 CENTS A SHARE. LICENSING REVENUES ARE EXPECTED TO SURPASS US$250-MILLION THIS FISCAL YEAR.

A SALE OF MOST BLACKBERRY PATENTS WOULD RESULT IN “A SHARP CHANGE OF BUSINESS DIRECTION BECAUSE THEY’VE BEEN QUITE SUCCESSFUL LICENSING THEIR PORTFOLIO,” SAID LOUIS CARBONNEAU, CEO WITH TANGIBLE IP, A SEATTLE PATENT BROKERAGE AND STRATEGIC ADVISORY FIRM.

BUT ""IT’S BAD NEWS EITHER WAY” FOR CANADA, HE SAID, BECAUSE THE PATENTS RESIDE HERE AND THE GOVERNMENT HAS SUBSIDIZED BLACKBERRY’S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OVER THE YEARS.

“YOU’VE GOT 40,000 PATENTS THAT BASICALLY WILL BE OWNED MOST LIKELY BY A NON-CANADIAN COMPANY,” PROBABLY A FINANCIAL FIRM THAT SPECIALIZES IN AMASSING PATENTS AND PURSUING LICENSING DEALS, SAID MR. CARBONNEAU, A CANADIAN WHO HAS PUSHED OTTAWA TO ATTACH STRINGS TO IP DEVELOPED WITH TAXPAYER MONEY SO THAT SOME BENEFITS REMAIN HERE EVEN AFTER A SALE.

OTHER INDUSTRY EXPERTS SAID A SALE OF BLACKBERRY’S PATENTS WOULD DEAL A BLOW TO THE COUNTRY’S STANDING AT A TIME WHEN THE GOVERNMENT [HAS BEEN MAKING INITIAL STEPS TO IMPROVE CANADA’S POOR REPUTATION FOR COMMERCIALIZING IDEAS.](HTTPS://WWW.THEGLOBEANDMAIL.COM/BUSINESS/ARTICLE-FEDERAL-GOVERNMENT-TO-LAUNCH-PATENT-COLLECTIVE-GIVING-CANADIAN/) BLACKBERRY IS ONE OF CANADA’S TOP 20 SPENDERS ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND WAS NUMBER ONE A DECADE AGO.

“THE SALE OF A MASSIVE BLACKBERRY PATENT PORTFOLIO WOULD KNOCK CANADA DOWN FURTHER IN THE GLOBAL PATENT OWNERSHIP RANKINGS,"" SAID NATALIE RAFFOUL, AN OTTAWA-BASED PATENT LAWYER WHO NOTED BLACKBERRY IS THE [SOLE CANADIAN FIRM AMONG THE WORLD’S TOP 100 PATENT HOLDERS.](HTTPS://WWW.IFICLAIMS.COM/RANKINGS-GLOBAL-ASSETS-2019.HTM) ""GIVEN THE ECONOMIC VALUE OF IP AND DATA ASSETS TODAY, CANADIAN GOVERNMENT LEADERS AND POLICY MAKERS NEED TO PERK UP TO THIS REALITY THAT WE CONTINUE TO LOSE GROUND ON OWNING THESE VALUABLE ASSETS. ""

MR. HINTON CALLED BLACKBERRY “THE LONE CANADIAN STANDOUT IN THE GLOBAL ARMS RACE FOR IP ACCUMULATION” EVEN AFTER IT STOPPED MAKING SMARTPHONES. A PATENT SALE WOULD LEAVE CANADA “HOLDING NO SIGNIFICANT POSITION IN A GLOBAL PATENT MARKET THAT REPRESENTS THE MOST VALUABLE ASSETS TODAY. I QUESTION WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD STEP IN TO ENSURE THAT CRITICAL \[PUBLICLY FUNDED\] IP ASSETS AREN’T BEING OFFSHORED FOR ECONOMIC AND NATIONAL SECURITY REASONS.”

JOHN POWER, A SPOKESMAN FOR INNOVATION, SCIENCE AND INDUSTRY MINISTER NAVDEEP BAINS SAID, “WE ARE UNABLE TO COMMENT ON SPECULATION INVOLVING COMMERCIAL TRANSACTIONS.” BUT MR. POWER ADDED THAT, “WHEN WE LOOK TO THE WORLD STAGE TO LEARN FROM OTHER SUCCESSFUL INNOVATION NATIONS, IT IS CLEAR THAT NO INNOVATION PLAN IS COMPLETE WITHOUT CLEAR SUPPORT FOR AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE STRATEGIC USE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.”",gcopcue,t3_jw8np9,1605671686,1605696886.0,/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/jw8np9/blackberry_looks_to_sell_majority_of_its_patents/gcopcue/
439,Dr_Meany,CanadianInvestor,"THOUGH I GENERALLY AGREE WITH THE SENTIMENT, THAT'S NOT ALWAYS TRUE. SOMETIMES COMPANIES WITH LOTS OF CASH FLOW AND LOW STOCK PRICES INVEST IN THEMSELVES. THIS IS WHAT KL IS DOING RIGHT NOW, AND WHAT APPLE HAS DONE FOR MUCH OF THE RECENT PAST. AS A LONGTIME SHAREHOLDER IN BOTH I THINK THIS IS FINE. IF YOUR COMPANY MAKES TONNES OF CASH AND HAS NOWHERE TO PUT IT, AND DOESN'T WANT TO FUCK AROUND WITH DIVIDEND INCREASES, THEN SHARE BUYBACKS ARE A GOOD DEAL FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED.

THE PROBLEM IS WHEN THERE'S FREE MONEY AND COMPANIES BORROW TO INCREASE SHARE PRICES. OR WHERE THEY MAKE SHORT SIGHTED CUTS TO IMMEDIATELY CUT COSTS TO INCREASE BUY-BACKS. THIS BENEFITS SHAREHOLDERS MILDLY IN THE IMMEDIATE TERM AND MASSIVELY BENEFITS EXECUTIVES WHO HAVE BONUSES TIED TO SHARE PRICE. AND C-SUITE FOLKS TEND TO MOVE IN AND OUT WITH ASTONISHING REGULARITY.

ONE REASON PEOPLE LIKE ETF'S IS THAT THERE IS BUILT IN DIVERSIFICATION WITH RELATIVELY LOW FEES. WHY LOOK FOR THE NEEDLE IN THE HAYSTACK WHEN YOU CAN JUST OWN THE WHOLE HAYSTACK.  ESPECIALLY BECAUSE TOMORROW'S (20 PLUS YEARS) APPLE OR AMAZON IS LIKELY A LITTLE KNOWN COMPANY RIGHT NOW.

SKEWNESS - MANY PEOPLE THINK STOCKS HAVE BETTER GROWTH.  IMO, THAT IS AN INCOMPLETE WAY OF LOOKING AT STOCKS. THEY HAVE A WIDER RANGE OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES. A FEW STOCKS WILL OUTPERFORM OVER A GIVEN TIME AND MOST OTHERS WILL UNDERPERFORM AND OTHERS WILL GO BANKRUPT.  A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF COMPANIES WILL MAKE THINGS LOOKING BETTER THAN THEY ACTUALLY ARE.  HERE'S A STUDY THAT SHOWS THAT 56% OF US STOCKS (AND 61% OF GLOBAL STOCKS) UNDER PERFORM 1 MONTH TREASURY BILLS. FROM [""DO GLOBAL STOCKS OUTPERFORM US TREASURY BILLS""](HTTPS://PAPERS.SSRN.COM/SOL3/DELIVERY.CFM/SSRN_ID3415739_CODE667.PDF?ABSTRACTID=3415739&AMP;MIRID=1)
  
P/E RATIO - SOME COMPANIES WILL OUTPERFORM THE MARKET AND THEIR SECTORS, BUT UNLESS THEIR PROFITS ARE ALSO GROWING AT THE SAME PACE IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE GROWTH IS SUSTAINABLE.

GROWTH AND DIVIDENDS - AS AN INVESTOR YOU ARE COMPENSATED BY HAVING THE RIGHTS TO FUTURE PROFITS.  THESE CAN COME FROM EITHER GROWTH IN THE MARKET CAP OF THE COMPANY OR THROUGH DIVIDENDS OR A COMBINATION.  IF A COMPANY IS PAYING OUT DIVIDENDS THEN THE MARKET WILL DISCOUNT ITS GROWTH OF MARKET CAP. IT'S 6 OR HALF DOZEN, DOESN'T MAKE A REAL WORLD DIFFERENCE.

506,palmeralexj,CanadianInvestor,"IF YOU HAVE NO ISSUES OF RISK TOLERANCE AND WANT HIGHER RETURNS, HAVE YOU CONSIDERED VEQT? THE BONDS DRAG OF VGRO IS SMALL BUT NOT INSIGNIFICANT.

ONE POINT I WOULD MAKE IS THAT WHILE YOUR QUESTION SPECIFIES OVER-DIVERSIFICATION, THE IDEA THAT STOCKS CREATE HIGHER RETURNS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED MORE THOROUGHLY.

EQUITIES INCREASE THE DISTRIBUTION OF POSSIBLE OUTCOMES.  WHILE THERE ARE SOME UNICORNS IN THE MIX THERE ARE ALSO MANY MANY MANY EVENTUALLY BANKRUPT COMPANIES.  SURVIVORSHIP BIAS IS A SIMPLE CONCEPT BUT IT'S A REAL BIAS.

SO YOU CAN CHOOSE A ""HOT"" SECTOR, LIKE TECH, BUT THOSE GAINS ALREADY HAVE THEIR FUTURE GROWTH POTENTIAL PRICED IN.  EVENTUALLY ONE OF TWO THINGS WILL HAPPEN. EITHER THOSE STOCKS WILL UNDERPERFORM THE STOCK MARKET(STATISTICALLY WHAT HAS HAPPENED) OR THEY WILL CONTINUE OUTPACING THE MARKET AND BECOME THE MARKET.

\- DO NOT INVEST THE FULL AMOUNT YOU HAVE IN ONE GO. THE MARKET COULD DROP AT ANY POINT AND YOU WANT TO HAVE MONEY IN YOUR BROKER ACCOUNT SO YOU'RE ABLE TO AVERAGE DOWN CONSIDER THE GIGANTIC BUBBLE WE ARE IN CURRENTLY.

511,fogduckker,CanadianInvestor,"MATT, GREAT ANSWER. BUYING IS THE EASY PART. SELLING OR WHEN TO SELL IS THE HARD PART. I THINK THAT THE NUMBER ONE MISTAKE THAT PEOPLE MAKE WITH THEIR PORTFOLIOS IS NOT ASKING THAT QUESTION; ""WOULD I BUY THE STOCK AT THESE PRICES TODAY?' AND EVEN IF THEY DID ASK THAT QUESTION AND THEY KNOW THAT THE ANSWER IS NO THEY STILL DON'T SELL BECAUSE THEY ARE IN THE RED - THE MOST SERIOUS MISTAKE YOU COULD LIKELY MAKE WITH YOUR PORTFOLIO!! RIP OFF THAT BANDAID !!! AND IF YOU CAN'T DO THAT THEN SWITCH TO CONSERVATIVE ETFS.

WHEN TO SELL ALSO GREATLY DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF STOCK OR SECTOR. LIKE IF YOU ARE IN A JUNIOR MINER WITHOUT PRODUCTION AND IT IS JUST MOVED BY DRILLING RESULTS THEN I WOULD SAY IF YOU DOUBLE THEN AUTOMATICALLY SELL HALF. ON THE OTHER HAND IF YOU ARE IN A STOCK LIKE NVDA I WOULD HAVE TO TOTALLY AGREE WITH BUFFET. BUFFETS POSITION IS THAT EVEN THO TRADITIONAL PORTFOLIO SAYS YOU SHOULD TRIM YOUR POSITION WHY WOULD YOU BE SO DUMB AS TO SELL ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING COMPANIES IN THE WORLD. CHECK OUT BUFFET'S WEIGHTING IN APPLE. BUFFET'S VIEW IS THAT DIVERSIFICATION IS FOR PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT CONFIDENT IN THEIR DD.

REMOVED FROM MY PORTFOLIO: PEPSI, AMERICAN EXPRESS, HUYA, BASIC FIT, INTEL, TCEHY, TESLA, 


THE 20 STOCKS I WANT TO KEEP IN MY PORTFOLIO STARTING FROM 22 SEPTEMBER 2020
🤩


APPLE:IF YOU DON’T OWN THIS YOU’RE JUST STUPID. REMEMBER PEOPLE LAUGHING AT THE AIRPODS, LOOK WHO’S LAUGHING AT WHO NOW. AT FIRST IT ALWAYS SEEMS USELESS OR STUPID BUT GUESS EFFING WHAT, THEY DO IT, IT WORKS AND THAT’S THE THING ABOUT APPLE. IT ALWAYS WORKS. OH YEAH ON AVERGAE 20% A YEAR RETURN :O

MICROSOFT: DO YOU SEE ANY OTHER COMPUTER BRAND IN THE WORLD TAKING OVER IN 30 YEARS TIME? EVERYBODY WHO WORKS WITH COMPUTERS HAS EFFING WINDOWS/MAC OS

COCA COLA: DO YOU THINK IN 30 YEARS PEOPLE WILL STOP DRINKING COKE? I HAD PEPSI IN MY PORTFOLIO AS WELL, UNFORTUNATELY DIDN’T PERFORM AS WELL AS COCA-COLA, DON’T DISLIKE PEPSI. BUT BETWEEN THE TWO OF THEM COCA IS THE BETTER INVESTMENT CHOICE

GOOGLE: COULD YOU SURVIVE SCHOOL/LIFE/DEATH WITHOUT OUR SEARCHING MACHINE? I DEFINITELY WOULD BE DEAD BY NOW IF NOT FOR GOOGLE. WITHOUT GOOGLE I WOULDN’T EVEN BE POSTING THIS HERE. 

MCDONALDS: BESIDES PEEPZ LOVE THEIR NUGGETS, DO YOU THINK IN 30 YEARS MCD WILL BE GONE? OH HELL NAH. YALL WOULD MURDER FOR SOME DAMN NUGGETS. A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK THEIR BUSINESS MODEL IS SELLING FASTFOOD, OH HELL NAH BRO, THEY IN THE REAL ESTATE BUSINESS, THEY THE DONS. 

NIKE: WHO DOESN’T OWN ANYTHING OF NIKE? THIS BRAND IS SO SO SO RECOGNIZABLE. THAT SWOOSH BRUH, WORN BY EVERYBODY. AIR JORDAN ALSO DOING WELL AFTER THAT DOCUMENTARY WITH MJ. ALSO HAVE YOU NOTICED THAT THEIR PRICES HAVE BEEN CREEPING UP? WELL? JUST BUY IT

JD.COM: THE AMAZON OF CHINA, HAS BEEN PERFORMING VERY WELL LATELY AND IT’S NOT COMPANY THAT WAS BUILD IN A COUPLE OF MONTHS. CEO HAS VISION AND HAS DONE VERY WELL SO FAR. YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY CHECK THIS COMPANY BEFORE YOU INVEST. (AS ALWAYS KNOW WHAT YOU’RE INVESTING IN)

LVMH: PEEPZ ARE STILL GONNA ROCK THAT WAY TOO EXPENSIVE LOUIS BAG AND DRINK CHAMPAGNE IN 30 YEARS. LIKE BRUH CHAMPAGNE AND COGNAC GOING OUT OF BUSINESS? IN 30 YEARS THERE WILL STILL BE IDIOTS IN THE CLUB POPPING CHAMPAGNE. SHOWING THAT DOM PERI PERI TRYING TO GET GIRLS. YEAH THOSE IDIOTS WILL STILL BE POPPIN IN 30 YEARS. 

VANECK ESPORTS: TWITCH, LOL, THE GAMERS, THE NICEU GAMERGIRLS THAT STREAM, UUHHH, WE ALL LOVE VIDEOGAMES NOWADAYS AND THIS MARKET HAS BEEN GROWING SO MUCH THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS. POPULARITY IS STILL RISING AND THIS MARKET HAS DEFINITELY A LOT OF ROOM TO GROW. 

WOLTERS KLUWERS: DUTCH COMPANY, BORING AS HELL, BUT A VERY SAFE INVESTMENT. SUPER BORING, SUPER STEADY. 

NVIDIA: WITH THEIR NEW 3070/3080 GPU’S THEY EFFED OVER A LOT OF PREVIOUS CUSTOMERS, BUT HEY, THEY DOING WELL, THEY LEADINNNNNNGGGG. PEOPLE WANT 244FPS(BRUH LIKE I CAN’T EVEN TELL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 60/100FPS) BUT OKAY OKAG, IF YOU WANT THOSE SPECS THEN YOU GOTTA BUY THEIR GPU. 

DISNEY: WHAT ARE YOUR KIDS GOING TO WATCH? WHAT THEME PARK ARE YOU KIDS GOING TO VISIT?

ALIBABA: IT’S NOT THE AMAZON OF CHINA. THEIR B2B PLATFORM, OH WOW SO GOOD. NO STOCK, JUST PEOPLE USING THEIR PLATFORM, THEY’RE CONNECTING PEOPLE, THEY’RE CONNECTING BUSINESS. ALSO THEY HAVE A BIG STAKE IN ANT AKA ALIPAY AKA THE MOST USED PAYMENT SYSTEM IN CHINA. BTW YOU BUY STUFF FROM ALIEXPRESS, WHO DO YOU THINK OWNS ALIEXPRESS?

MEDTRONIC: INNOVATIVE LEADER IN THE WORLD OF HEALTH CARE, THEY MADE THE FIRST PACEMAKER. STILL EVOLVING AND INNOVATING TO THIS DAY. HEALTHCARE WILL NEVER GO OUT OF BUSINESS, IF YOU GET VERY SICK YOU’LL NEED TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL, YOU WANT QUALITY STUFF, YOU WANT THE ‘APPLE’ OF HEALTHCARE.

CISCO IS A VALUABLE COMPANY AND MAKES A LOT OF MONEY, BUT PEOPLE'S EXPECTATIONS SEVERELY OVERPRICED WHAT PEOPLE WERE PAYING FOR IT. IF YOU BOUGHT NEAR THE TOP AND HELD ALL THIS TIME, YOU HAVE NOT GOT YOUR MONEY BACK NOT FACTORING IN DIVIDENDS.

THAT IS GOING TO BECOME LARGER THAN TESLA AUTO AND WILL BE THE REAL GAME CHANGER IN HOW THIS COMPANY OPERATES. THEY DON'T PLAN TO MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT PROFITS WITH TESLA AUTO. ELON CONFIRMED THIS IN THE EARNINGS CALL.

HOWEVER IF WE WANT TO FOCUS ON JUST THE AUTO PART, LET'S DO THAT. LET'S NOT GET THIS WRONG. TESLA WILL BE THE FIRST TO MARKET WITH FSD (FULL SELF DRIVING). THEIR DATA IS GROWING AT AN EXPONENTIAL RATE AND THAT IS ONLY TRAINING THEIR DRIVING MODEL TO BE BETTER AT A FASTER RATE. IT WILL COME OUT BY END OF 2020. BATTERY DAY WILL SHOW A SIGNIFICANT TECH OVERHAUL WITH THEIR BATTERIES. BETTER DENSITY, BETTER MILEAGE, FASTER CHARGING, MAYBE ALL OF THEM. ONCE THEY RELEASE FSD, THEY WILL FOCUS ON PRODUCTION OF CYBERTRUCK. THEY WILL ALSO BE PLANNING A MODEL FOR CHINA. THE RUMOUR IS A MORE COMPACT CAR. 

ONCE WE MOVE BEYOND THE CAR ITSELF, WE CAN TALK ABOUT THEIR ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM WHICH A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE JUST SKIPPING OVER. ONCE FSD IS MORE COMMON PLACE, THEY WILL BEGIN USING THEIR ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM TO GENERATE ADDITIONAL REVENUE. THINK OF IT LIKE THE APPLE APP STORE. WE'VE GOTTEN SNEAK PEAKS OF WHAT IT CAN DO. THERE IS MUCH MORE TO EXPLORE HERE.

LET'S TALK TESLA INSURANCE. BY HOUSING INSURANCE IN HOUSE, THEY ARE ABLE TO SEE COMMON ISSUES AND CLAIMS. THIS WILL ALLOW THEM TO RECTIFY AND STRENGTHEN PARTS IN THEIR CARS TO MITIGATE THOSE RISKS.

TAKE EXAMPLE OF APPLE. IN 2016, IT DID REVENUE WORTH 215 BILLION AND EARNING PER SHARE WAS $8.35. LAST YEAR THEY HAD REVENUE OF 260 BILLION. 7% YEARLY GROWTH. EPS WAS NEAR ABOUT $12.. 12% YEARLY GROWTH. IN THE MEANTIME STOCK PRICE WENT UP FROM$130 TO $470 .. NEARLY 3.5 TIMES, TRANSLATES TO 50% YEARLY GROWTH. IT'S A PHENOMENAL COMPANY. THAT'S GIVEN.  BUT IS THIS KIND OF PRICE GROWTH JUSTIFIABLE OR SUSTAINABLE? YOU CAN ALSO CHECK SIMILAR STATS FORCE AMAZON, NETFLIX, ZOOM, TESLA.. YOU CAN EASILY SEE IF IT'S A BUBBLE OR NOT..

THE ONLY INFORMATION WE CAN GET OUT FROM THIS IS THAT HE'S SWITCHED A BIT HIS PREVIOUS STANCE ON GOLD, HE'S WILLING TO EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY THAT A GOLD MINER MAY BE A GOOD INVESTMENT, BUT THE BARRICK GOLD POSITION IS STILL A ""TRY-OUT"" BUY, NOT A ""UNDOUBTEDLY"" BULLISH VIEW ON GOLD YET. NOT YET. 

THE ONLY REASON WHY SOME PEOPLE JUMP TO CONCLUDE THAT BUFFETT BUYING BARRICK GOLD IS A BULLISH VIEW ON GOLD, IS DUE TO CONFIRMATION BIAS, THOSE PEOPLE WERE ALREADY INTO GOLD PRIOR TO THIS EVENT, SO THEY'LL LOOK FOR ANY EVIDENCE TO PROVE THEIR POINT. 

I FIND IT FUNNY THAT SOME PEOPLE SAY HE WAS WRONG ABOUT AIRLINES, BUT WHEN THOSE SAME PEOPLE SEE HE INVESTED A SMALL AMOUNT (BY BUFFETT STANDARD) IN A GOLD MINER, THEY'RE LIKE ""YES YES YES"" HE'S BULLISH ON GOLD. THAT'S NAIVE.

PRICE TO SALES IS ~ 7.7. FOR COMPARISON TESLA HAD A PRICE TO SALES OF 7.5 AT THE END OF JULY (IT'S NOW ~ 11). APPLE HAS A PRICE TO SALES OF 7.5. NETFLIX AND FACEBOOK ~ 9.5. 

EV/REVENUES IS 15 AND EV/EBITDA IS 28. THIS IS A REAL ESTATE PLAY SO NOI AND AFFO WOULD BE BETTER METRICS TO MEASURE IF THE STOCK IS CHEAP OR NOT. BUT STILL NO GENERIC METRIC ABOUT THIS STOCK SAYS CHEAP.

I USED TO LOVE THEIR COFFEE, NOW IT TASTES LIKE CRAP AND I GUESS MCDONALD’S TOOK OVER THEIR ORIGINAL SUPPLIER WHICH EXPLAINS WHY IT WAS SO EASY TO MAKE THE SWITCH SOME 8-10 OR SO YEARS AGO WHEN I STARTED TO NOTICE IT.

THEIR DONUTS USED TO BE BAKED IN STORE, NOW THEY’RE FROZEN AND SHIPPED IN, I HAVEN’T EVEN ORDERED ONE IN YEARS BUT I RECALL THEM NOW BEING THESE SEMI-STALE, BLAND OFFERINGS WITH LOTS OF DECORATION...

THEY TRY TO TUG AT OUR PATRIOTIC STRINGS IN THEIR COMMERCIALS AND ADVERTISING BUT THE AVERAGE PERSON IS SMARTER THAN THAT NOW AND MANY NORMAL PEOPLE KNOW AT LEAST THAT THEY ARE OWNED BY SOME OUT-OF-COUNTRY CONGLOMERATE THAT ALSO OWNS THINGS LIKE BURGER KING.

IF THEY WANT TO SAVE THE BRAND, IN MY OPINION, THEY NEED TO LOOK TO APPLE FOR INSPIRATION. SIMPLIFY YOUR OFFERINGS AND DO THEM BETTER. IF YOU’RE GONNA CHARGE MORE THAN MCDONALD’S FOR COFFEE, AT LEAST MAKE SURE IT DOES TASTE BETTER AND OFFER MANY LESS THINGS, BUT ENSURE THEY’RE OF A HIGHER QUALITY.

MY GUESS IS THAT WON’T HAPPEN MOSTLY BECAUSE IT WILL INVOLVE TOO MUCH INITIAL LOSS AND TAKE TOO LONG TO WIN PEOPLE BACK. GOTTA REPORT THEM GAINS.",g0ktoyr,t3_i4t7j2,1596731627,1596756827.0,/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/i4t7j2/tim_hortons_sales_fall_by_onethird_as_rbi_feels/g0ktoyr/

BECAUSE THE CODERS ARE LAZY AND I KNOW YOU ALL GOING TO LOSE SLEEP TONIGHT: 

LIGHTSPEED CEO SUED FOR ALLEGEDLY STEALING TECH USED TO LAUNCH FIRM COMPANIES TIED TO A FORMER EMPLOYER OF DAX DASILVA ARE CHARGING IN A LAWSUIT THAT THE LIGHTSPEED FOUNDER STOLE KEY TECHNOLOGY AND USED IT TO LAUNCH HIS $3.8-BILLION FIRM. LAWYERS ACTING ON BEHALF OF NUMBERED COMPANIES LINKED TO FREDERICK ROSENBERG, THEN-PRESIDENT OF MONTREAL-BASED BRENROSE SOLUTIONS, SAY DASILVA USED THE SOURCE CODE DEVELOPED AT HIS COMPANY TO BUILD A POINT-OF-SALE SOFTWARE (POS) THAT WOULD LATER BECOME LIGHTSPEED’S FIRST PRODUCT. DASILVA HAS SPENT THE PAST FOUR YEARS UNSUCCESSFULLY TRYING TO GET THE LAWSUIT DISMISSED AND ATTEMPTING TO NEGOTIATE, ACCORDING TO OVER A HUNDRED PAGES OF DOCUMENTS FILED IN QUEBEC SUPERIOR COURT REVIEWED BY HE AND LIGHTSPEED HAVE DENIED ALL WRONGDOING AND FILED A COUNTERSUIT. DAX DASILVA, THE CEO OF ONE OF CANADA’S FASTEST-GROWING TECH COMPANIES, IS FACING A $30-MILLION LAWSUIT FROM COMPANIES TIED TO A FORMER EMPLOYER. HE AND LIGHTSPEED HAVE DENIED ALL WRONG DOING, AND HAVE BEEN UNSUCCESSFULLY TRYING TO GET IT DISMISSED FOR THE LAST FOUR YEARS. LIGHTSPEED IS ONE OF CANADA’S FASTEST-GROWING TECH FIRMS, WITH A MARKET CAP OF ABOUT $3.8 BILLION. ITS STOCK HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED SINCE GOING PUBLIC ON THE TORONTO STOCK EXCHANGE IN MARCH 2019. THE FIRM HAS GROWN TO OVER 900 EMPLOYEES ACROSS 14 OFFICES WORLDWIDE. IN 2019, DASILVA WAS NAMED INNOVATOR OF THE YEAR BY BOTH THE CANADIAN INNOVATION EXCHANGE AND THE GLOBE AND MAIL. ACCORDING TO THE SUIT, DASILVA WORKED AT BRENROSE AND HELPED DEVELOP A POS SOFTWARE CALLED IRON, WHICH HE THEN USED TO DEVELOP LIGHTSPEED’S ONSITE PRODUCT. ABOUT SIX MONTHS AFTER LEAVING BRENROSE, DASILVA LAUNCHED LIGHTSPEED AND SOLD THE ONSITE SOFTWARE TO STORES OFFERING MAC COMPUTERS AND OTHER APPLE PRODUCTS, THE SAME KIND OF FIRMS TO WHICH BRENROSE HAD SOLD, THE SUIT READS. BRENROSE FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY IN OCTOBER 2004, AT WHICH POINT IT OWED CREDITORS ABOUT $2.8 MILLION. TWO QUEBEC-BASED FIRMS, 99257 CANADA LTD. AND 3811981 CANADA INC., SUBSEQUENTLY ACQUIRED IRON AND ALL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS TO THE SOFTWARE, ACCORDING TO A DECEMBER 2019 RULING BY THE QUEBEC SUPERIOR COURT. THE TWO FIRMS FILED THE LAWSUIT AGAINST DASILVA AND LIGHTSPEED AND HAVE AGREED TO SHARE THE PAYOUT WITH BRENROSE’S FORMER PRESIDENT ROSENBERG IF THEY WIN. DASILVA AND LIGHTSPEED HAVE JOINTLY FILED A COUNTERSUIT ACCUSING THE DEFENDANTS OF “PROCEEDING WITHOUT CONDUCTING ANY REASONABLE INQUIRY INTO THE FACTS ALLEGED, MOST IMPORTANTLY IN RESPECT OF WHETHER OR NOT LIGHTSPEED ONSITE ACTUALLY REPRODUCES ANY SUBSTANTIAL PART OF IRON, WHICH IT CLEARLY DOES NOT.” LIGHTSPEED DECLINED TO COMMENT. DASILVA AND ATTORNEYS FOR THE NUMBERED COMPANIES DID NOT RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR COMMENT. ATTEMPTS TO CONTACT ROSENBERG WERE UNSUCCESSFUL. THE LAWSUIT WAS FIRST FILED FOUR YEARS AGO IN JUNE 2016. THE PARTIES ENTERED INTO NEGOTIATIONS, BUT AFTER SEVERAL EXTENSIONS, THOSE TALKS BROKE DOWN. IN COURT FILINGS FROM APRIL 2018, LIGHTSPEED’S ATTORNEY ASKED A JUDGE TO DISMISS THE LAWSUIT, DECLARE IT “ABUSIVE” AND ORDER THE PAYMENT OF DAMAGES. THE COMPANY MADE THE SAME REQUEST IN JUNE 2019, AND ALSO ASKED THE COURT TO FORCE SEVERAL INDIVIDUALS AND CORPORATIONS TO BE ADDED TO THE LAWSUIT. IN A DECEMBER 2019 RULING, THE QUEBEC SUPERIOR COURT DECLINED TO ADD ROSENBERG TO THE CASE IN A PERSONAL CAPACITY, BUT ADDED HYMAN BLOOM AND ÉMILE SYLVESTRE, BUSINESSMEN INVOLVED WITH THE COMPANIES THAT PURCHASED THE ASSETS OF BRENROSE SOLUTIONS AFTER IT WENT BANKRUPT. THE NUMBERED COMPANIES ARE ASKING THE COURT FOR $27 MILLION, OR HALF THE PROFITS THEY CLAIM LIGHTSPEED MADE “DUE TO THE ILLEGAL USE AND COPYING” OF THE IRON SOFTWARE BETWEEN 2005 AND 2016. IN ADDITION, THEY’RE SEEKING $3 MILLION IN DAMAGES AND AN “ONGOING ROYALTY,” AT A PERCENTAGE TO BE DETERMINED, ON FUTURE SALES. “IN A NUTSHELL: MR DASILVA PARTICIPATED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ‘IRON’ WHILE HE WAS EMPLOYED BY BRENROSE, THEN LEFT BRENROSE WITH ‘IRON’ TO CREATE LIGHTSPEED AND SELL A PRODUCT THAT IS VERY SIMILAR TO AND BASED ON ‘IRON’ TO THE SAME CUSTOMERS BRENROSE WAS TARGETING WHEN DEVELOPING ‘IRON,’” READS THE SUIT. IN COURT FILINGS, DASILVA AND LIGHTSPEED ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THE TWO MEN DEVELOPED THE IRON SOFTWARE TOGETHER AND THAT ONSITE USES THE SAME PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE, BUT SAID THEY WERE “DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT PRODUCTS,” AND THAT DASILVA DEVELOPED ONSITE AFTER LEAVING BRENROSE, WITHOUT REPRODUCING ANY PART OF IRON. HE “WAS PARTICULARLY CAREFUL NOT TO DO SO AS HE KNEW THAT MR. ROSENBERG WAS A LITIGIOUS PERSON,” ACCORDING TO THE SUIT. THE PLAINTIFFS’ COURT FILINGS PUT IT DIFFERENTLY: “LIGHTSPEED GOT ITS START AS A RETAIL SYSTEM BUILT FOR A MAC DEALERSHIP WITH FOUR STORES. THE PROJECT ENDED UP GETTING SHELVED, BUT OTHER APPLE DEALERSHIPS WERE INTERESTED, SO DASILVA TOOK THE BEST IDEAS AND STARTED LIGHTSPEED IN 2005.” BOTH DASILVA AND ROSENBERG ARE LISTED AS AUTHORS OF THE IRON SOFTWARE, ACCORDING TO A MAY 2016 FILING WITH THE CANADIAN COPYRIGHT REGISTER. THE LOGIC ON THE COPYRIGHT SUIT IN FEBRUARY 2019, AHEAD OF LIGHTSPEED’S INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING. IN ITS PROSPECTUS, THE FIRM DISCLOSED POTENTIAL DAMAGES OF $30 MILLION FROM THE LAWSUIT. ASKED ABOUT THE COURT CHALLENGE A MONTH LATER, DASILVA SAID, “I DON’T WANT TO COMMENT TOO MUCH ON IT, BECAUSE THESE KINDS OF LAWSUITS HAPPEN WHEN COMPANIES ARE SUCCESSFUL. IT’S WITHOUT MERIT AND THE PEOPLE BEHIND IT ARE NOT IN TECHNOLOGY. I’LL JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT.” WHEN ASKED BY ABOUT THE NEWLY DISCOVERED COURT DOCUMENTS ACKNOWLEDGING THAT HE DEVELOPED THE IRON SOFTWARE WITH ROSENBERG, DASILVA DID NOT RESPOND.",g0iws6x,t3_i4ft3a,1596687161,1596712361.0,/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/i4ft3a/lightspeed_ceo_sued_for_allegedly_stealing_tech/g0iws6x/

715,SportsDogsDollars,CanadianInvestor,"1 -  LOTS TO INVEST EACH PAYCHEQUE, SO YOU CAN DEFINITELY GET ON TRACK! KEEP THOSE THOUGHTS POSITIVE! EVEN JUST POSTING THIS IS A GREAT WAY TO TAKE A POSITIVE FIRST STEP FORWARD TOWARDS IMPROVING YOUR FINANCIAL FUTURE!

2 - QUESTRADE VS WEALTHSIMPLE WILL BE IRRELEVANT COMPARED TO INITIAL ACTION OF BEGINNING YOUR INVESTING ADVENTURE! THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO  START MAKING ROUTINE (IDEALLY AUTOMATED) INVESTMENT CONTRIBUTIONS. IN THE LONG RUN SAVING 0.1% ON A MER, OR SAVING $0.50 ON A COMMISSION DOSN'T MATTER COMPARED TO YOU TAKING THE FIRST STEPS AND ACTUALLY GETTING SOME OF YOUR PAYCHEQUE INTO AN INVESTMENT VEHICLE. 

3 AND 4 - I'D RECOMMEND STARTING OUT WITH SOME BROAD BASED ETFS., BUT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION: THE EXCHANGE RATE ISN'T THE BEST RIGHT NOW, BUT WHO'S TO SAY WHERE IT WILL GO LONG TERM. IF THE CAD DOLLAR FALLS FURTHER YOU'D ACTUALLY MAKE MONEY IF YOU HAD EXCHANGED IT INTO AMERICAN. THE CONVERSION FEES CAN BE BIG. 

IF YOU ARE INTERESTED IN TECH, TRY A NASDAQ 100 HEDGED ETF. IT IS THE TOP 100 COMPANIES ON THE NASDAQ, WHICH IS A VERY TECH HEAVY INDEX. A NASDAQ 100 ETF WILL HAVE BIG HOLDINGS IN APPLE, GOOGLE, FACEBOOK, AMAZON ETC. BUT  WILL ALSO HAVE SOME HOLDINGS IN THINGS LIKE PEPSICO, MONSTER BEVERAGE, STARBUCKS ETC. 

IF YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT EXCHANGE RATE, YOU CAN BUY A HEDGED ETF. THAT MEANS THEY'VE REDUCED THE LIKELY HOOD OF THE ETF CHANGING IN VALUE BASED ON EXCHANGE RATES CHANGING. THEORETICALLY THE ETF WILL ONLY GO UP OR DOWN IF ITS UNDERLYING STOCKS GO UP OR DOWN

RRSPS ARE ACTUALLY THE BEST PLACE TO HOLD DIVIDEND PAYING AMERICAN STOCKS. THE US RECOGNIZES RRSPS AS REGISTERED RETERIEMENT ACCOUNTS, AND THE US WILL NOT WITH HOLD ANY OF THE DIVIDEND. IN A TFSA OR NON-REGISTERED ACCOUNT THE USA WOULD TAKE 15% OF YOUR DIVIDEND AS A TAX. 

5  -IT COULD WORK GREAT, YOU COULD HAVE A MUCH LARGER DOWN PAYMENT IF THINGS GO UP, BUT IT COULD ALSO GO THE OTHER WAY AND YOU COULD LOSE 35% OF YOUR DOWNPAYMENT. THAT'S A RISK ONLY YOU CAN THINK ABOUT AND ANSWER BASED ON YOUR GOALS AND RISK TOLERANCES. 

6 - THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS TO GET YOUR MONEY INVESTED IN A WELL DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO. THIS WILL BE EASIEST DONE BY INVESTING IN LOW FEE ETFS, USING A STRATEGY SUCH AS THE CANADIAN COUCH POTATO.

RSPS ARE FOR RETIREMENT; TFSAS ARE FOR THINGS LIKE BUYING A HOUSE. MY ADVICE WOULD BE TO LEAVE YOUR RSP ALONE ONCE YOU'VE GOT IT SELF-DIRECTED; THEN, IF YOU'RE GOING TO PUT MONEY INTO ANY ACCOUNTS, PUT IT INTO INVESTMENTS IN A TFSA. THEN WITHDRAW THAT IN 5-10 YEARS IF YOU'RE LOOKING TO BUY A HOUSE; IT'LL BE TAX-FREE. IF YOU WITHDRAW FROM YOUR RSP IN 5-10 YEARS, YOU'RE PAYING TAXES ON THAT ONE-TIME WITHDRAWAL, WHICH WILL BE STEEP. IF YOU'RE GOING TO WITHDRAW FROM AN RSP, YOU'RE BETTER OFF DOING IT GRADUALLY (I.E.

ADDITIONALLY, THERE IS A MAX AMOUNT YOU CAN WITHDRAW FOR THE FIRST TIME HOMEOWNER BENEFIT (I THINK IT IS 35K). 

REGARDLESS, AN ALL-IN-ONE ETF OFFERED BY BOTH VANGUARD OR BLACKROCK IS THE PERFECT WAY TO INVEST  MONEY WITHIN YOUR REGISTERED ACCOUNTS.

721,PhrugalPhysicist,CanadianInvestor,"1. PRETTY MUCH, STARTING WITH THE EMERGENCY FUND MEANS YOU'VE GOT THE RIGHT MINDSET GOING INTO THIS. LOTS OF PEOPLE WANT TO JUMP RIGHT INTO INVESTING WITHOUT ESTABLISHING EMERGENCY FUNDS, MANAGING DEBT, LEARNING SAVING HABITS, AND DOING SOME READING.
2. QUESTRADE IS PRETTY GOOD, IT'S WHAT I USE. WEALTHSIMPLE CAN ALSO DO THIS, IT HAS SOME LARGER EXCHANGE FEES FOR CAD TO USD IF YOU ARE BUYING STOCKS DIRECTLY VS CANADIAN LISTED ETFS OR (SHUDDERS) MUTUAL FUNDS.
3. DEFER TO SOMEONE ELSE
4. PERSONALLY I DON'T THINK GOING RIGHT INTO INDIVIDUAL STOCKS IS THE BEST PLACE TO START, BUT LOTS OF PEOPLE HERE (VS R/PERSONALFINANCECANADA) WOULD TOTALLY DISAGREE AND IT'S NOT A BLACK AND WHITE ISSUE, EVERYONE IS DIFFERENT AND HAS DIFFERENT RISK TOLERANCES. IF YOU ONLY GO WITH APPLE YOU AREN'T DIVERSIFIED VERY WELL, YOU COULD BUILD A DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO AND THEN OVERWEIGHT IN APPLE IF YOU REALLY LIKE IT. I OVERWEIGHT MY PORTFOLIO IN TECH USING THE TEC.TO ETF FROM TD.
5. IF YOU PLAN TO PULL MONEY OUT IN 5 YEARS OR LESS THE RULE OF THUMB WOULD BE DON'T INVEST IT IN THE STOCK MARKET AND INSTEAD LEAVE IT IN A HISA (HIGH INTEREST SAVINGS ACCOUNT). YOU CAN GET \~2% AT EQ BANK OR OTHER ALTERNATIVES TO THE BIG FIVE. 5 YEARS IS A SHORT TIME FRAME IN THE INVESTING WORLD. SO IF YOU'RE REALLY FOCUSED ON SAVING A DOWN PAYMENT YOU MIGHT WANT TO RETHINK INVESTING THE MONEY EARMARKED FOR THAT. IF YOU'RE LOOKING LONGER TO 8-10 YEARS YOU COULD INVEST IN A LOWER RISK PORTFOLIO (I.E. MORE BONDS/FIXED INCOME VS STOCKS).
6. I'M BORING AND LIKE A PASSIVE INVESTMENT STRATEGY SO I'D RECOMMEND READING UP ON INDEX INVESTING OR THE ""COUCH POTATO PORTFOLIO"" WHERE YOU USE INDEX ETFS TO DIVERSIFY AND TRACK US, CANADIAN, INTERNATIONAL INDEXES. GOOD PLACE TO START WOULD BE THE CANADIAN COUCH POTATO AND CANADIAN PORTFOLIO MANAGER BLOGS BY TWO VERY KNOWLEDGABLE CANADIAN FINANCE GUYS. THESE KINDS OR PORTFOLIOS CAN NOW BE IMPLEMENTED WITH A SINGLE ETF CALLED ASSET ALLOCATION ETFS, OFFERED BY VANGUARD, ISHARES, AND BMO IN VARYING STOCK/BOND MIXES. EXAMPLES, VBAL IS 60% STOCKS 40% BOND, VGRO 80/20, VEQT, 100/0 AND THE STOCKS PORTION IS SPLIT BETWEEN US, CANADA, INTERNATIONAL, AND EMERGING MARKETS EQUITIES. THEY ARE AUTOMATICALLY REBALANCED TO KEEP THE ALLOCATION CLOSE TO THE DESIGNATED SPLIT.

GENERAL ADVICE, SOUNDS LIKE YOUR HEAD'S IN THE RIGHT PLACE AND YOU NEED TO EDUCATE YOURSELF A LITTLE MORE. I'D REALLY SUGGEST READING SOME BOOKS FROM ANY READING LIST OF CANADIAN PERSONAL FINANCE BOOKS AS A PLACE TO START. THIS SUBREDDIT,  THE PERSONAL FINANCE CANADA SUB, GLOBE AND MAIL ARE ALL PRETTY GOOD RESOURCES.

2.) BEST IS SUBJECTIVE BUT THOSE TWO OPTIONS ARE QUITE POPULAR SO I CAN'T SEE YOU GOING WRONG WITH EITHER. DEPENDS ON HOW YOU PLAN TO INVEST TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS OF EACH RESPECTIVE BROKERAGE.

3.) CONVERSION RATES SOMETIMES STEER CANADIANS AWAY FROM INVESTING IN THE US BUT THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT US STOCKS WILL GENERALLY OUTPERFORM ANY CURRENCY CONVERSION RATE. LOOK INTO NORBERT'S GAMBIT, IT IS A METHOD THAT PRACTICALLY ELIMINATES THE SURFACE LEVEL COST OF CONVERTING, BUT OF COURSE COMES WITH OWN PROBLEMS SUCH AS OPPORTUNITY COST.

2. CAPITAL GAINS. 

THIS IS FROM PROFITING FROM SHARE PRICE APPRECIATION. IF YOU HOLD THE SHARES IN TFSA, YOU DON’T NEED TO WORRY ABOUT THIS AT ALL. IF YOU ARE NOT US TAX RESIDENTS, THEN NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT.

NO IT'S NOT. CAPITAL GAINS (HOW MUCH YOU SELL - HOW MUCH YOU BOUGHT FOR) ISN'T TAXED, ONLY DIVIDENDS.

I START CASHING OUT MY JUNIORS ON A SLIDING SCALE, SAME AS ANY OTHER GROWTH STOCK. AS THEIR VALUE INCREASES THERE WILL BE OTHER VALUE ELSEWHERE TO TAKE PROFITS AND REINVEST. OR, THERE WILL BE PROFITS THAT CAN BE DIVERSIFIED ELSEWHERE WITHIN THE SAME GROWTH SECTOR. SOME I TOOK OUT TOO QUICK (KL) AND SOME I LEFT IN TOO LONG (K). MY KL PLAY MAKES ME FEEL LIKE A FUCKING GENIUS, HOLDING K FOR SO LONG MAKES ME FEEL LIKE A SUCKER. NEEDLESS TO SAY, THE MINERS ARE MUCH LIKE ANY OTHER COMMODITY-BASED STOCK. HOWEVER, THEY TRADE AT A DISCOUNT FOR A FEW REASONS. ONE IS BECAUSE THEY'RE SO HEAVILY CANADIAN AND AMERICANS JUST CAN'T BE FUCKED GENERALLY. 

BUT IT'S ALSO THAT LOTS OF MINERS HAVE MILLIONS OF WARRANTS OUT AND SHIT WHICH MEANS THE INSIDERS ALWAYS GET PAID FIRST. THEY ALSO TEND TO HAVE LOTS OF PEOPLE WHO BOUGHT 10,000 SHARES AT $0.53 AND CASH OUT LARGE CHUNKS AT $10+, SO WITH LOW VOLUME PRICES CAN REALLY FUCKING MOVE. THIS SCARES OFF A LOT OF RETAIL, AND THE BAD MANAGEMENT PRACTICES OF THE PAST SCARE OFF THE INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS.

895,edwin-w,CanadianInvestor,"I FORGOT A COUPLE MORE STOCKS I HOLD IN MY TFSA - APPLE AND MICROSOFT. APPLE HAS BEEN A MULTIBAGGER FOR ME AS WELL, WHILE I HAVEN'T HELD MICROSOFT AS LONG SO IT'S ONLY UP AROUND 60%. THEY'RE BOTH US DIVIDEND PAYING STOCKS SO THERE'S A WITHHOLDING TAX OF 15% ON THE DIVIDENDS THAT'S AUTOMATICALLY DEDUCTED.

I COULD WRITE A LOT ABOUT HOLDING US STOCKS IN A TFSA. I'M ACTUALLY STRONGLY AGAINST THE COMMONLY HELD WISDOM THAT YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE DIVIDEND PAYING US STOCKS IN YOUR TFSA. YOU SHOULD HAVE STOCKS THAT GET YOU THE BEST RETURN, ESPECIALLY IF THE GAINS COME IN THE FORM OF CAPITAL APPRECIATION. YOU HAVE TO RUN THE NUMBERS.

HERE'S AN EXAMPLE WITH BALLPARK NUMBERS AND VARIOUS SIMPLIFICATIONS. LET'S SAY 5 YEARS AGO YOU INVESTED $20,000 IN COSTCO. THE DIVIDEND YIELD IS CURRENTLY 1%. OVER THE FIVE YEARS, YOU WOULD HAVE RECEIVED ROUGHLY $200 A YEAR IN DIVIDENDS, SO ABOUT $1,000 TOTAL. IF YOU HELD THIS STOCK IN A TFSA, YOU WOULD HAVE LOST $150 IN WITHHOLDING TAX. HOWEVER, THE COSTCO STOCK PRICE DOUBLED IN FIVE YEARS. SO YOUR GAIN AFTER TAXES IS $20,850. YOU'VE GIVEN UP LESS THAN 1% OF YOUR GAINS IN TAXES!

COMPARE THIS TO HOLDING IT IN AN RRSP. THERE'S A SLIGHT WRINKLE HERE IN THAT YOU'RE GETTING AN EXTRA BENEFIT FROM BOTH A TAX DEFERRAL, AND THE LIKELIHOOD THAT YOU'LL BE EVENTUALLY BE WITHDRAWING FROM YOUR RRSP AT A LOWER TAX RATE. IN ANY CASE, ASSUMING YOU HOLD THE SAME $20,000 IN COSTCO STOCK HERE, IT WOULD HAVE GROWN $21,000 IN VALUE INCLUDING DIVIDENDS. HOWEVER, YOU WILL EVENTUALLY HAVE TO PAY TAX AT YOUR MARGINAL WITHDRAWAL RATE, AND UNLESS YOU'RE WITHDRAWING LESS THAN YOUR BASIC PERSONAL AMOUNT PER YEAR YOU'LL ALMOST BE CERTAINLY PAYING MORE IN TAX.

SOME MAY SAY THAT'S IT'S NOT FAIR TO PICK A STOCK THAT DOUBLED IN FIVE YEARS AS AN EXAMPLE. MY WHOLE POINT IS THAT YOU SHOULD PICK STOCKS THAT HAVE A CHANCE OF BEING MULTIBAGGERS IN THE LONG TERM, AND THE BEST PLACE TO HOLD THEM IS IN YOUR TFSA. AS I MENTIONED, I HOLD APPLE AND MICROSOFT WHICH HAVE PERFORMED EVEN BETTER THAN COSTCO. I ALSO HOLD COSTCO AND VISA, UNFORTUNATELY THEY'RE IN MY RRSP. THE LONGER YOU HOLD A STOCK THAT BECOMES A MULTIBAGGER, THE GREATER THE ADVANTAGE OF HOLDING IT IN YOUR TFSA, AS THE 15% WITHHOLDING TAX ON DIVIDENDS IS EFFECTIVELY LESS THAN A 1% TAX ON GAINS!",fvohrk7,t3_hdtivn,1592862383,1592887583.0,/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/hdtivn/anyone_actually_get_audited_by_cra_for_an_active/fvohrk7/

THIS WAS AN EXCELLENT, WELL-WRITTEN, AND INFORMATIVE POST. I HAVE DONE SOME BASIC RESEARCH ON MARGINS BEFORE; HOWEVER, THERE IS ONE PART OF YOUR POST WHICH I DO NOT UNDERSTAND. YOU STATE THAT:

**""SAY APPLE IS MARGINABLE AT 30% (THE HAIRCUT) BY YOUR BANK. YOU DECIDE YOU WANT TO BORROW ON MARGIN. BUT YOU DECIDE, ""I WILL ALLOW APPLE TO SLIDE 40% FROM WHAT I BUY IT AT BEFORE I GET A MARGIN CALL."" SO HOW MUCH MARGIN SHOULD YOU PUT UP?""**

I AM A BIT CONFUSED WITH THE PART WHERE ""I"" GET TO DECIDE WHEN ""I"" WILL GET A MARGIN CALL (I.E. WHEN APPLE SLIDES TO 40% FROM WHAT I BOUGHT). I AM NOT AN EXPERT, BUT I THOUGHT THAT THE BROKERAGE COMPANY TECHNICALLY COULD MAKE A MARGIN CALL WHENEVER THEY WANTED. AM I MISSING SOMETHING HERE? IT SOUNDS LIKE IN YOUR EXAMPLE THAT ""I"" CAN TELL MY BROKERAGE NOT TO MAKE A MARGIN CALL UNLESS APPLE DROPS TO $210 FROM $350 AS PER YOUR EXAMPLE. PLEASE CLARIFY. THANK YOU IN ADVANCE.",fvecqqi,t3_hbskjb,1592616705,1592641905.0,/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/hbskjb/how_margin_loans_work_a_primer/fvecqqi/
906,catsaysmrau,CanadianInvestor,"&GT; HOW SO? I SAW A COMMERCIAL FOR MAPLE LEAF'S 50/50 PRODUCTS AND THOUGHT THEY WEREN'T A HALF-BAD IDEA.

SEE BELOW:

&GT; I'VE TRIED VARIOUS MEAT SUBSTITUTES IN THINGS LIKE CHILI AND PASTA SAUCE, AND IT'S NOT EVEN CLOSE TO BEING AN ACCEPTABLE SUBSTITUTE.


EXACTLY. IT'S A HIGHER COST HALF MEASURE. MEAT EATERS ON THE WHOLE AREN'T ENTICED, THEY'D RATHER HAVE ALL MEAT FOR FLAVOUR PURPOSES. VEGETARIANS/VEGANS AREN'T ENTICED, THEY DON'T EAT MEAT. HEALTH-WISE, BURGERS/SAUSAGES AREN'T A HEALTH FOOD. THEY ARE A GREASY GUILTY PLEASURE FOOD. THE VEGGIE/VEGAN SUBSTITUTES AREN'T HEALTHY EITHER, THEY'RE JUST HEALTHIER THAN THE ALTERNATIVE OF EATING A MEAT VERSION. 


I JUST TAKE SEVERE ISSUE WITH THE MARKETING TERM FOR THESE PRODUCTS ""FLEXITARIAN"". WHAT REALLY IS A FLEXITARIAN? IF A PERSON DOESN'T EAT LAND BASED MEATS BUT STILL EATS SEAFOOD, THAT'S JUST A PESCATARIAN, AND THEY WOULD NOT EAT THE 50/50 BLENDS. IF THEY DON'T EAT MEAT OR SEAFOOD BUT STILL EAT EGGS AND DAIRY, THAT'S VEGETARIAN, AND THEY WOULD NOT EAT THE 50/50 BLENDS. IF THEY DON'T EAT ANY ANIMAL PRODUCTS WHATSOEVER, THAT'S VEGAN, AND THEY WOULD NOT EAT 50/50 BLENDS. IF THEY ARE A MEAT EATER AND THEY WOULD EAT THE 50/50 BLENDS? THAT'S JUST A REGULAR OMNIVORE DIET, STILL EATING MEAT WHILE EATING FRUITS, VEG, GRAINS, ETC. TOO. EATING AN APPLE DOESN'T MAKE A PERSON FLEXITARIAN. IT'S JUST MEANS THEY'RE AN OMNIVORE EATING AN APPLE. I FIND IT FRUSTRATING AND PATRONIZING. AND THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE WILLING TO PURCHASE 50/50 BLENDS ARE EXCEEDINGLY TINY, JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THE RETAIL SPACE ALLOCATED TO SUCH PRODUCTS. IT'S A MINUTE FRACTION. IT'S SO SOME EXECUTIVE SOMEWHERE CAN PUT A FEATHER IN THEIR CAP WHEN FACING THE BOARDS QUESTION ON ""WHAT CAN WE DO? PEOPLE ARE INCREASINGLY SHIFTING AWAY FROM EATING MEAT. HOW DO WE RETAIN SALES WITHOUT ATTACKING OUR MAINSTREAM PRODUCTS?"" IT'S SETS UP THE NOTION IN THE CONSUMER'S MIND THAT IT IS HARDER AND VERY DIFFICULT TO NOT EAT MEAT, IT'S A CONSTRUCTED ROADBLOCK ON THE WAY TO BEING A VEGETARIAN/VEGAN. AND THAT IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE. IT IS EASY AS HELL ONCE A PERSON MAKES THE CONSCIOUS CHOICE, JUST A LITTLE DISCIPLINE, AND IT BECOMES SECOND NATURE. I DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT MY OWN DIET, I EAT WHAT I EAT.


&GT; THE THREE R'S OF SUSTAINABILITY ARE REDUCE, REUSE, AND RECYCLE, SO IF PRODUCTS LIKE 50/50 MEAT/PLANT-BASED CAN WIN OVER THOSE OF US WHO CAN'T ABIDE 100% PLANT-BASED SUBSTITUTES, IT'S STILL A NET WIN. NO?


I DON'T REALLY WANT TO GET INTO THE WHOLE ETHICAL DEBATE OF THINGS HERE. CONVERSATION FOR ANOTHER TIME, SO I'LL JUST STATE THIS. IT'S HONESTLY NOT ""CAN'T ABIDE"", IT'S ""WON'T ABIDE""... SUBTLE DIFFERENCE. I TAKE ISSUE WITH THE APPROACH OF A HALF AND HALF BECAUSE IT'S STILL HARMFUL, AND THOSE WHO DO PARTAKE FALSELY (IN MY OPINION) GET THE WARM FUZZIES OF [HELPING AN IMPORTANT CAUSE](HTTPS://PBS.TWIMG.COM/MEDIA/EOX_2N_WSAAHDZE.JPG).",fvd7qy9,t3_hbl7i3,1592594008,1592619208.0,/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/hbl7i3/is_anyone_considering_taking_a_position_in_very/fvd7qy9/
907,dashed,CanadianInvestor,"GOOD POST!

I ARRIVED WITH SIMILAR FORMULAS USING THE DEFINITION OF MAINTENANCE EXCESS AND MARKET VALUE AS FOLLOWS:


    MAINTENANCE EXCESS = EQUITY - MARKET VALUE * MARGIN REQUIREMENT
    
    MARKET VALUE = EQUITY + CURRENT LOAN
    
    EQUITY = MARKET VALUE - CURRENT LOAN (REARRANGEMENT OF ABOVE)
    

THE INVARIANT WE WANT TO MAINTAIN IS `MAINTENANCE EXCESS &GT; 0`. SO WITH SOME ALGEBRIAC MANIPULATION, WE HAVE:


    MAINTENANCE EXCESS &GT; 0
    
    EQUITY - MARKET VALUE * MARGIN REQUIREMENT &GT; 0
    MARKET VALUE - CURRENT LOAN - MARKET VALUE * MARGIN REQUIREMENT &GT; 0
    MARKET VALUE * (1 - MARGIN REQUIREMENT) - CURRENT LOAN &GT; 0
    
    MARKET VALUE &GT; (CURRENT LOAN) / (1 - MARGIN REQUIREMENT)
    
    EQUITY + CURRENT LOAN &GT; (CURRENT LOAN) / (1 - MARGIN REQUIREMENT)


WITH THE ABOVE INEQUALITY, WE CAN INTRODUCE SOME VARIABLES WHICH CAN BE USEFUL.

IF WE HAVE USED UP ALL OUR CASH, WHAT IS THE *MAXIMUM* MARGIN LOAN (I.E. **NEW LOAN**) CAN WE TAKE ON TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL SECURITIES BEFORE BEING MAGIN CALLED?


    EQUITY + CURRENT LOAN + NEW LOAN &GT; (CURRENT LOAN + NEW LOAN) / (1 - MARGIN REQUIREMENT)


ASSUMING WE CAN STOMACH A *MAXIMUM* MARKET VALUE DROP OF `MARKET DROP` BEFORE BEING MARGIN CALLED, THEN HOW MUCH MARGIN LOAN CAN WE TAKE OUT BEFORE BEING MARGIN CALLED?


    (1 - MARKET DROP) * MARKET VALUE &GT; (CURRENT LOAN + NEW LOAN) / (1 - MARGIN REQUIREMENT)
    (1 - MARKET DROP) * (EQUITY + CURRENT LOAN + NEW LOAN) &GT; (CURRENT LOAN + NEW LOAN) / (1 - MARGIN REQUIREMENT)
    

------

BASED ON YOUR EXAMPLE, IF WE HAVE $3000 IN CASH TO BUY APPLE SHARES, WE CAN DETERMINE THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF MARGIN LOANS WE CAN USE BASED ON OUR RISK PROFILE AND THE MARGIN REQUIREMENTS WITH `MARKET DROP = 0.4` AND `MARGIN REQUIREMENT = 0.3`: HTTPS://WWW.WOLFRAMALPHA.COM/INPUT/?I=%281+-+0.4%29+*+%283000+%2B+X%29+%3E+%28X%29+%2F+%281+-+0.3%29

I’M ALSO SURE ANYONE CAN EASILY FIND A DECENT PUBLICLY-LISTED COMPANY AND BUY THEIR SHARES AND PERHAPS GET AN ALRIGHT RETURN EITHER THROUGH DIVIDENDS OR PRICE GROWTH. BUT STOCK-PICKING IN THE INVESTING WORLD IS NOT THAT. WHEN YOU STOCK-PICK YOU GO THROUGH MULTIPLE COMPANIES TO FIND ONE THAT IS UNDERVALUED RELATIVE TO ITS INTRINSIC VALUE. THERE AREN’T MANY OUT THERE, BECAUSE THE STOCK MARKET CAN SOMETIMES BE REALLY EFFICIENT (NOT ALWAYS, THAT’S WHY YOU FIND OPPORTUNITIES). IF I GO AHEAD AND INVEST IN ANY DECENT COMPANY OUT THERE, LIKE YOU WOULD DO, SAY APPLE, I’M MOST LIKELY PAYING FAIR VALUE FOR IT, SO THERE’S NO SPACE FOR GROWTH AVAILABLE TO ME UNLESS THEY BEAT EARNINGS OR HAVE A GOOD NEWS RELEASE, ESSENTIALLY A BET. IF THEY DON’T, THEN I’M JUST GOING TO DEPEND ON THE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND THEY’LL BE GIVING ME, FOR ME TO QUANTIFY SOME SORT OF VALUE TO MYSELF OUT OF HOLDING THOSE SHARES. THAT’S NOT WEALTH-BUILDING INVESTING. THAT’S JUST WHAT EVERY RETAIL INVESTOR DOES. STOCK PICKING IS VERY HARD, AND YOU CAN’T PROVE THE OPPOSITE.

929,KhingoBhingo,CanadianInvestor,"IT'S NOT FREE. THEY BUILD THEIR STOCK TRADING COMMISSION INTO THE SPREAD, JUST THE WAY THEY BUILD THE FX CONVERSION FEE INTO THE EXCHANGE RATE. THE REAL EXCHANGE RATE MIGHT BE $1.3366 CAD/USD BUT YOU GET $1.3168 CAD/USD WHEN YOU SELL YOUR USD.

&AMP;#X200B;

EVERYONE IN CANADA DOES THAT WITH FX, BUT RH (NOT YET AVAILABLE IN CANADA) ALSO DOES THE SAME THING WITH STOCKS. IF YOU BUY OR SELL ANY GIVEN STOCK YOU WILL PAY MORE AND RECEIVE LESS THAN YOU WILL WITH A COMMISSION BROKER THAT DOESN'T RE-SELL YOUR ORDER TO A HFT.

&AMP;#X200B;

SO IF YOU WANTED TO BUY AIR CANADA YOU MIGHT SEE A SPREAD OF 3 CENTS WITH BMO IL (NESBITT BURNS),  OR IBKR WHICH EXECUTE ALL TRADES IN-HOUSE, SAY $20.15/$20.18 ON THE BID AND ASK.  WITH MOST ZERO-COMMISSION TRADERS LIKE RH, YOU'LL SEE A SPREAD OF MORE LIKE 4 CENTS. ON A $40,000 TRADE THAT MIGHT COST YOU $40 TO EXECUTE, ROUND TURN BUT ONLY SAY $20 WITH A BROKER THAT CHARGES TRADITIONAL COMMISSIONS. WEALTHSIMPLE CLAIMS ON THEIR WEBSITE THAT THEY DO NOT DO THIS BUT THAT IS NORMALLY HOW ""FREE STOCK TRADING"" WORKS, AND IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF YOU REALLY DO GET AS GOOD AN EXECUTION AS WITH BROKERS LIKE BMO AND IBKR.

954,agtledevyday,CanadianInvestor,"WHAT MAKES YOU THINK EXCHANGES AROUND THE GLOBE WILL IMPLODE AS A RESULT OF THIS CRISIS? AFTER READING THAT ENTIRE POST OF YOURS I’M GUESSING IT’S THE DEBT ALL THESE CORPORATIONS HAVE TO THEIR NAME. WELL, IT’S ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THAT. CORPORATIONS CAN’T BECOME THE BEST AND THE BRIGHTEST WITHOUT DEBT, COUNTRIES CAN’T PROGRESS WITHOUT DEBT... AND UNFORTUNATELY YOU’RE JUST NOT EXPERIENCED ENOUGH TO RECOGNIZE THAT. THIS SIMPLY SCARES YOU. WHEN I SEE BUFFET TELLING ME THAT THESE DOWNTURNS HAVE ALWAYS HAPPENED AND WILL ALWAYS HAPPEN I KNOW I DON’T HAVE MUCH TO ADD TO THAT. 

I’LL TELL YOU WHY THIS CRISIS ISN’T GOING TO BE WHAT YOU THINK IT WILL BE. FIRST OF ALL, WHAT ARE BONDS? BECAUSE YOU DON’T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND THEM. BONDS ARE JUST LIKE LOANS. THEY HAVE YIELDS WHICH ARE BASICALLY THE INTEREST PAID ANNUALLY TO THE ISSUER OF THE BOND BY THE HOLDER. THEY ALSO HAVE MATURITY DATES, WHICH IS WHEN THE HOLDER PAYS OFF THE PRINCIPLE. OUR CENTRAL BANK, SINCE MARCH, HAS BEEN PURCHASING A LOT OF FEDERAL, PROVINCIAL AND CORPORATE BONDS. NOW, THE CENTRAL BANK ACTUALLY PURCHASES BONDS EVEN DURING NORMAL TIMES, THIS IS PART OF THEIR JOB. THEY PROVIDE SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY TO GOVERNMENTS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, LIKE BANKS. WHAT’S DIFFERENT THIS TIME? WELL, THEY’RE PURCHASING CORPORATE BONDS WHICH THEY’VE NEVER DONE BEFORE. SO, BEFORE WE GO INTO DETAIL REGARDING THE CORPORATE BONDS PART, I HAVE TO SAY THAT THERE’S LITTLE TO NO RISK TO THE CENTRAL BANK WHEN ISSUING ALL THESE BONDS TO THE FEDERAL AND PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENTS. THEY HAVE NEVER AND WILL NEVER DEFAULT. THIS AMOUNT OF DEBT WILL HAVE AN EFFECT ON US IN THE FUTURE IN THAT OUR PRODUCTIVITY AS A NATION WILL BE HINDERED BECAUSE OF THE TAXES WE’LL NEED TO PAY IN ORDER TO PAY OFF THESE MASSIVE AMOUNTS OF BONDS. BUT, BUT, BUT NOTHING IS GOING TO GO ON FIRE, IT’S ALL FINE. NOW, DON’T BE FOOLED, THE CORPORATE BONDS THE CENTRAL BANK HAS BEEN PURCHASING ARE NOT WHAT YOU THINK.   THEY’RE NOT PURCHASING EVERYBODY’S DEBT. THEY’RE PURCHASING DEBT FROM THOSE REALLY GOOD COMPANIES THAT ARE IN RISK OF DEFAULT AS A RESULT OF NO LIQUIDITY IN THE SHORT TERM. THINK HERTZ AND APPLE (JUST AN EXAMPLE). THE FEDERAL RESERVE DIDN’T GO OUT AND PURCHASE HERTZ’S BONDS, BECAUSE THEY HAVE A SHIT CREDIT RATING, BUT THEY WILL GO OUT AND BUY APPLE’S IF THEY WEREN’T ABLE TO MAKE THEIR INTEREST PAYMENTS. 

ALL OF THAT ASIDE, ON TO THE MARKETS. CANADA’S CENTRAL BANK AND THE FEDERAL RESERVE MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THEY’RE READY TO BUY UP EVEN MORE BONDS AND PROVIDE ALL THE LIQUIDITY NECESSARY IN THE CREDIT MARKETS. SO, WE KNOW FOR SURE THAT CREDIT MARKETS AREN’T GOING TO DRY UP LIKE THEY DID IN THE FINANCIAL CRISIS. WE’RE ALREADY AHEAD. IF YOU WANT CONFIDENCE TO INVEST IN THE MARKET THEN THAT’S ENOUGH. IN REALITY, IT ALL REALLY COMES DOWN TO WHAT YOU’RE GOING TO BE INVESTING IN. INVEST IN INDUSTRIES THAT WILL NOT BE HIT HARD IN THE UPCOMING SECOND AND THIRD QUARTER EARNINGS. YOU ALSO WANT BUSINESSES THAT ARE CASH HEAVY SO THEY DON’T HAVE TO GO INTO MASSIVE DEBT LIKE AIRLINES RIGHT NOW. YOU DON’T WANT TO INVEST IN DESPERATE BUSINESSES. I’M NOT FOLLOWING THAT ADVICE THOUGH, I’M INVESTING IN OIL, RETAIL, AND EVEN FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. AS LONG AS (LIKE BUFFET SAYS) IT’S A WONDERFUL BUSINESS AT A FAIR PRICE I’M INVESTING IN IT. ALL THOSE INDUSTRIES ARE AT A RISK IN THE SHORT TERM (OIL PRICES TOO LOW, CONSUMER DEMAND TOO LOW, AND LOAN LOSSES TOO HIGH) BUT WE KNOW FROM THE PAST THAT THIS IS MERELY ANOTHER DOWNTURN THAT WE WILL GET THROUGH. AND YOU WILL BE A VERY LUCKY SHAREHOLDER THEN. GOOD LUCK.",fsp8zdj,t3_gvie4z,1591148722,1591173922.0,/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/gvie4z/can_someone_explain_why_its_still_a_good_idea_to/fsp8zdj/

INCOMPATIBLE, CAN'T BE BOTH. GOOD MONEY = BAD INVESTMENT, GOOD INVESTMENT = BAD MONEY. 

WHAT IS ACCEPTED AS MONEY IS ALWAYS CHANGING. THROUGH HISTORY IT'S BEEN EVERYTHING FROM SHELLS, BEADS, STONES AND GOLD. ANYONE IN POSSESSION OF THESE ITEMS PRIOR TO MASS ACCEPTANCE HAS BENEFITED FROM APPRECIATION IN PURCHASING POWER. THEY MAY HAVE STARTED OUT AS SPECULATIVE ASSETS, BUT EVENTUALLY BECAME THE DOMINANT FORM OF MONEY. 

&GT;
PRETTY BROAD DEFINITION OF THEFT. NEITHER INFLATION NOR DEFLATION IS THEFT. ARE YOU ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE THAT CLAIMS TAXATION IS THEFT TOO?...

MONEY IS A PLACE HOLDER FOR TIME AND ENERGY. WE OFTEN DON'T REQUIRE A PRODUCT OR SERVICE AT THE SAME TIME WE PRODUCE SOMETHING. SO WE USE MONEY AS A GLOBAL IOU THAT CAN BE REDEEMED IN THE FUTURE. IF I SPEND MY TIME AND ENERGY TODAY SO THAT I CAN REDEEM THAT TIME AND ENERGY IN THE FUTURE I DON'T WANT MY FUTURE SELF TO NOT RECEIVE MY FULL RE PAYMENT. ANYTHING THAT ROBS ME OF MY TIME AND ENERGY IS THEFT. 

&GT;
SO WHAT'S THE ALTERNATIVE? LET MANY PEOPLE GO BANKRUPT, AND OR STARVE? OR JUST SWITCH OVER TO BTC AND SOLVE ALL OF SOCIETY'S ECONOMIC WOES? /S

THE GLOBAL FIAT MONETARY SYSTEM HAS BACKED THEMSELVES INTO A CORNER. THEY HAVE NO ALTERNATIVE BUT TO PRINT MONEY. SINCE LEAVING THE GOLD STANDARD IN 1971 THEY HAVE, THROUGH CONSTANT INFLATION, INCENTIVIZED PEOPLE NOT TO SAVE FOR A RAINY DAY. WHY SAVE MONEY THAT'S GOING TO BE WORTH LESS IN THE FUTURE? IF WE HAD A MONEY THAT RETAINED IT'S PURCHASING POWER MAYBE THE COMPANIES AND BUSINESSES TODAY WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE IT THROUGH A SINGLE MONTH OF LOW/ NO INCOME WITHOUT HAVING TO LOOK FOR A HAND OUT. JUST BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T HAVE ANOTHER CHOICE, DOESNT MEAN WE DON'T. WE CAN CHOOSE TO STORE OUR WEALTH IN THINGS THAT ARE NOT ARTIFICIALLY INFLATED AT THE WHIMS OF ELECTED (AND NON ELECTED) OFFICIALS. THIS ISN'T JUST BITCOIN, BUT ALSO GOLD.

BTC IS CONFUSING AND OBTUSE TO REGULAR PEOPLE, UNSTABLE AND VOLATILE.

ALL VALID POINT. MOST PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS. BUT IF YOU WERE TO ASK THEM HOW THE CURRENT FIAT BANKING SYSTEM WORKS YOU WOULD ALSO GET THE SAME REACTION. THE AVERAGE PERSON DOESN'T HAVE TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT WORKS TO USE IT THOUGH. WITH TIME, JUST LIKE ANY NEW TECHNOLOGY, THE USER EXPERIENCE WILL GET BETTER. 

AS FOR THE STABILITY AND VOLATILITY, BITCOIN IS IN IT'S INFANCY. IT'S CURRENT MARKET CAP IS LESS THAN THAT OF APPLE, OR ANY OF THE OTHER BIG FAANG STOCKS. THE VOLATILITY COMES FROM THE FREE MARKET ATTEMPTING TO FIGURE OUT A FAIR MARKET PRICE FOR SOMETHING IT'S NEVER SEEN BEFORE.

THEY COULD'VE PAID YOU OUT A DIVIDEND, WHICH YOU COULD USE TO BUY OTHER STOCKS (OR SPEND HOWEVER YOU LIKE), BUT THEY KEPT THE MONEY BECAUSE THEY (SO FAR SO GOOD) HAVE HAD THE ABILITY TO GROW IT OVER TIME BETTER THAN YOU. SO BERKSHIRE SINCE 1965 HAS HAD SOMETHING LIKE 20% RETURNS VS. THE S&AMP;P 500 WHICH HAS HAD MORE LIKE 10%. SO WHERE IS THE 'COMPOUNDING'? THE COMPOUNDING IS JUST THAT IF YOU STARTED WITH $1000 AND IT TURNED INTO $1200 (AFTER YOUR 20% RETURN) YOU ENTER INTO YEAR 2 WITH $1200 AND GET YOUR 20% ON THAT. ON AND ON. WHEN YOU DON'T GET THE DIVIDEND YOU WOULD SEE THIS GROWTH IN SHARE PRICE (BERKSHIRE WAS $15 IN 1965 AND WAS $340,000 BEFORE COVID). SO THOUGH YOU DIDN'T GET A DIVIDEND...YOU WOULD'VE DONE ALRIGHT.

1016,hinault81,CanadianInvestor,"IN THEORY I AGREE, BUT I THINK IN PRACTICE COMPANIES CAN BE WASTEFUL AND NOT REALLY HAVE INVESTORS BEST INTERESTS IN MIND AND A DIVIDEND CAN KEEP THEM HONEST. I THINK IT'S TOO SIMPLISTIC TO SAY: NON DIVIDEND PAYER = GROWTH. KO HAS PAID A DIVIDEND 50+ YEARS AND CONTINUED TO GROW. IT'S JUST THAT THEY DON'T NEED ALL THEIR MONEY TO GROW, SO THEY SHARE SOME PROFITES. 

AS A BUSINESS OWNER WE HAVE COSTS, UPDATES WE NEED TO HAVE THROUGH THE PLANT, AND AREAS WE WANT TO GROW IN TO AND THAT TAKES MONEY. SOME YEARS IT TAKES ALL THE MONEY. BUT OTHER YEARS YOU HAVE A SURPLUS AND AS OWNERS WE TAKE SOME OF THAT OUT. DOES A COMPANY NEED 100% OF PROFITS, AND WITH THAT CAN IT GROW ALL OF IT BETTER THAN YOU CAN? IF YES, SAY BERKSHIRE OR AMAZON, FINE, KEEP THE MONEY. IF NO, THEY SHOULD LOOK AT PAYING SOMETHING TO INVESTORS/OWNERS. BECAUSE IT'S VERY POSSIBLE FOR COMPANIES TO GROW WHILE STILL PAYING SOMETHING IN A DIVIDEND (APPLE). IF YOU LISTEN TO BRK MEETINGS OR READ THEIR REPORTS YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY ABSOLUTELY HAVE THE BEST INTEREST OF THE INVESTOR IN MIND. THEY HAVE A VERY STRATEGIC REASON FOR NOT PAYING A DIVIDEND THAT BENEFITS THE SHAREHOLDER. 

I THINK SOME COMPANIES JUST DON'T HAVE SHAREHOLDERS BEST INTERESTS AT HEART, AND WOULD RATHER KEEP THE MONEY THAN GIVE BACK TO SHAREHOLDERS, AND I THINK AT THAT POINT THEY'RE WRONG.

APPLE IS OVERVALUED AND GOING TO FALL BEHIND IN THEIR PRIMARY MARKET (SMARTPHONES, DEVICES).

AC IS DUE FOR A SLOW RECOVERY.

BELL AND OTHER LANDLINE PROVIDERS WILL GET HAMMERED ON PRICE BY WIRELESS SERVICES LIKE STARLINK AND 5G NETWORKS WILL STRAIN THEIR BUDGETS DURING ROLLOUT.   I ALSO AM NOT BULLISH ON THEIR CONTENT OFFERINGS, ALTHOUGH THEY'RE IN A BETTER SPOT THAN ROGERS ON THAT.

TD WILL BE FINE, BANKS WILL DO ALRIGHT.

MICROSOFT IS A GOOD EXAMPLE.  


32% OF YOUR INVESTMENT IN VGRO IS ALLOCATED TO VUN. 

100% OF VUN IS ACTUALLY VTI. 


THE TOP STOCK IN VTI IS MICROSOFT.  ABOUT 5% OF IT. 

SO FOR $100 IN VGRO $32 GOES TO VTI. 

$1.60 OF THAT $32 IS MICROSOFT.  
ESSENTIALLY MICROSOFT IS 1.6% OF VGRO.  

NOW WITH TEC.TO ABOUT 13% IS MICROSOFT. 

IF YOU BOUGHT EQUAL AMOUNTS OF VGRO AND TEC ($100 EACH TO KEEP IT SIMPLE) YOU WOULD HAVE $14.60 WORTH OF MICROSOFT OR 7.3% OF YOUR TOTAL PORTFOLIO.   

BY ADJUSTING THE AMOUNT THE AMOUNT OF TEC YOU ADD YOU ARE OVERWEIGHTING OR EMPHASIZING THE TECH SECTOR.  

MICROSOFT, APPLE, AMAZON, FACEBOOK, GOOGLE, VISA ARE THE TOP COMPANIES HELD BY BOTH TEC AND BY EXTENSION VGRO THROUGH VUN/VTI.  

IF TECH OUTPERFORMS OTHER SECTORS THEN YOUR PORTFOLIO WILL BE POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY THE DECISION. 

IF EMERGING MARKETS OR DEVELOPED OR RESOURCES OR FINANCIALS OR BONDS OR SOME OTHER SECTOR OUTPERFORMS TECH THEN YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF WITH JUST VGRO.  

BASICALLY IT’S A GOOD THING TO OVERWEIGHT IF TECH DOES WELL. 


FWIW I PERSONALLY ADD SOME VFV TO MY VEQT HOLDINGS TO OVERWEIGHT THE US MARKET  S&AMP;P 500. 


IF YOU WANT TO ADD THIS EMPHASIS ZQQ OR XQQ OR THE OTHER NASDAQ TRACKING ETFS ARE ALSO A GOOD WAY TO ADD EMPHASIS. THEY ARE ONLY ABOUT 50% TECH AND ADD EXPOSURE (TECHNICALLY OVER EXPOSURE ) TO HEALTHCARE AND OTHER SECTORS.  ALL OF WHICH WILL ALSO BE DUPLICATED IN VUN.

SOMEONE WHO PRIMARILY INVESTS IN THE S&AMP;P500 AND THEN INVESTS FURTHER IN $TEC WOULD BE HEAVILY EXPOSED IN THE TECH SECTOR. SEE MY CONCERN?

WHAT I WOULD BE MORE INTERESTED IN IS AN ETF THAT HOLDS MORE MID/SMALL CAP TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES THAT MAY BECOME MAJOR DISRUPTORS IN THE FUTURE.

THESE STOCKS SEEM LIKE GOOD BUYS BECAUSE THEY'VE DROPPED EVEN MORE THAN MOST.  BUT THE REASON WHY THEY'RE SO CHEAP IS THAT, IN TIMES OF CRISIS, THERE'S A [FLIGHT TO QUALITY](HTTPS://EN.WIKIPEDIA.ORG/WIKI/FLIGHT-TO-QUALITY);  PEOPLE ONLY WANT TO OWN THE SAFEST OF THINGS.   

THE REASON WHY BIG TECH IS SO RICHLY VALUED, EVEN STILL, IS BECAUSE THEY GENERALLY HAVE BULLET-PROOF BALANCE SHEETS.  APPLE HAS SOMETHING LIKE $200 BILLION IN NET CASH;  GOOGLE AND MICROSOFT HAVE OVER $100 BILLION EACH;  FACEBOOK HAS OVER $50 BILLION.  THEY COULD EACH HAVE ZERO DOLLARS IN SALES FOR YEARS WITHOUT EVEN NEEDING TO SLOW THEIR SPENDING.  THERE'S TREMENDOUS SAFETY IN THAT.  

[COMPARE THAT TO A COMPANY LIKE CINEPLEX.](HTTP://IRFILES.CINEPLEX.COM/ANNUAL%20REPORT%202019%20FINAL.PDF)  THEY'VE ONLY GOT $26 MILLION IN CASH ON HAND.  THAT'S NOT EVEN ENOUGH TO PAY THREE MONTHS WORTH OF DIVIDENDS, LET ALONE THEIR LEASE PAYMENTS.   THEY'VE ALSO GOT $625 MILLION IN LONG-TERM DEBT THAT THEY'LL EVENTUALLY HAVE TO REFINANCE.

IT'S A BAD IDEA TO TRY TO PICK INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES AS A NOVICE INVESTOR.  EVEN IF YOU'RE SURE THAT COFFEE IS GOING TO MAKE A STRONG COMEBACK, YOU NEED TO BE ABLE TO READ AND UNDERSTAND THEIR FINANCIAL REPORTS IN ORDER TO KNOW WHY SECOND CUP IS A BETTER OR WORSE INVESTMENT THAN STARBUCKS OR ANY OF THEIR PEERS.

HOWEVER, THIS ALSO MEANS IN A BEAR MARKET, NASDAQ EXPERIENCED MORE LOSSES- BUT THIS IS ANOTHER TOPIC ON ITS OWN.

1060,MushroomCake28,CanadianInvestor,"&GT; I AGREE WITH YOU REGARDING NOT BUYING ANY OF THESE STOCKS UNLESS IT IS ON A DISCOUNT , FOR EXAMPLE I WILL NOT BUY ANY OF THE SOLID TECHS STOCKS LIKE AMAZON, APPLEMICROSOFT OR GOOGLE UNLESS THEY ARE AT LEAST 30-40% LESS THAN WHAT THEY WERE BEFORE THE CRASH ? ( REASONABLE?) 

REASONABLE IS EVALUATED ON A CASE BY CASE, AND DIFFERENT METHODS OF EVALUATING FAIR PRICE MAY GIVE YOU DIFFERENT ANSWERS. I ALWAYS TAKE APPLE AS AN EXAMPLE. IT'S HISTORICAL P/E RATIO USUALLY HOVERS BETWEEN 12 AND 15, AND WITH LAST YEAR'S EPS, FAIR PRICE WOULD BE $190 (15 X $12.60, ROUGHLY). IT IS NOW TRADING AT NEAR $270, SO INCREDIBLY OVERPRICED, AND THAT'S IF YOU CONSIDER THAT ITS REVENUE WON'T FALL FROM THIS INCOMING RECESSION (DON'T FORGET, 86.15% OF ALL NET SALES OF APPLE COME FROM RETAIL, ITS SERVICES SIDE ONLY BRING IN 13.85% OF ITS NET SALES). 

&GT; ALSO OVERALL IF THE MARKET CONTINUES TO TO GET BULLISH I WILL NOT BUY A SINGLE STOCK AND WILL CANCEL MY PLAN ALL TOGETHER. 

NOT A GOOD PLAN IMO. ONLY INVESTING IN BEAR MARKETS WILL MAKE YOU MISS A LOT OF GOOD OPPORTUNITIES IN A BULL MARKET. YOU'LL LIKELY MISS OUT MORE THAN YOU'D MAKE BACK BUYING AT A BEAR MARKET'S BOTTOM. IF YOU WANT TO PICK INDIVIDUAL STOCKS, THEN YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT EACH ONE AS AN INDIVIDUAL OPPORTUNITY AND TRY NOT TO BUY BASED ON MACROECONOMICS.

FOR EXAMPLE, BANKS WERE CHEAP EVEN BEFORE THE BEAR MARKET, SOME WERE TRADING AT LIKE 10.5 FORWARD EARNINGS WHICH IS CHEAP. NOW THE PRICES ARE EVEN CHEAPER.

&GT; I WILL ONLY START CHERRY PICKING WHEN MARKET IS LIKE 10% ABOVE THE CRASH THAT HAPPENED ON BLACK MONDAY. 

SEE PARAGRAPH ABOVE. BUT ALSO, I STILL BELIEVE WE'LL SINK LOWER THAN THE CURRENT BOTTOM. YOU SHOULD CHECK CHARTS OF PREVIOUS BEAR MARKETS, IT'S A SERIES OF NEW BOTTOM, RALLY UP, ANOTHER NEW BOTTOM, A NEW RALLY, ETC. ESPECIALLY IF YOU CONSIDER THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF THIS NEW RECESSION, THERE'S STILL PLENTY OF ROOM TO GO DOWN. FEAR OF MISSING OUT REALLY SUCKS, BUT THE STOCK MARKET IS REALLY A GAME OF TRYING TO BEAR YOUR NATURAL INSTINCTS. 

&GT; PS: I’M A NEWBIE WITH STOCKS BUT I LEARNED WHAT P/E RATIO IS ;) MY STRATEGY IS TO ONLY BUY STOCKS WITH A P/E RATIO OF LESS THAN 25 AND I’M COMPARING THEM TO THE LAST 5 YEARS AVERAGE P/E RATIO TO MAKE SURE I’M GETTING A GOOD DISCOUNT ON THE STOCK ( SOUNDS RIGHT) 

LOL, FOR NEW INVESTORS A P/E OF 25 MIGHT SOUND REASONABLE, BUT IN REALITY THAT'S OVERPRICED FOR MOST BUSINESSES. BENJAMIN GRAHAM RECOMMENDED BETWEEN 10 AND 20, GENERALLY AROUND 12, AND INSTITUTIONS LIKE A P/E OF 12 (AND SO DO I). HOWEVER, P/E IS NOT THE ONLY INDICATOR AND A FAIR P/E MIGHT VARY DEPENDING ON OTHER FACTORS, LIKE:

* INTEREST RATE: LOWER INTEREST RATE MEANS HIGHER FAIR P/E, AND HIGHER INTEREST RATE MEANS LOWER FAIR P/E.
* GROWTH: HIGHER EXPECTED GROWTH MEANS HIGHER FAIR P/E.
* MARKET CAP AND STABILITY: MORE STABLE AND SAFER COMPANIES (LIKE BIG MARKET CAP) USUALLY WARRANTS A HIGHER FAIR P/E.

25 IS STARTING TO GET VERY HIGH. THAT MEANS THAT IN THE CURRENT STATE, THE COMPANY WILL TAKE 25 YEARS TO PAY BACK WHAT YOU INVESTED. PE MEANS PRICE / EARNINGS, SO IF YOU PAID $25 FOR A STOCK THAT EARNS $1 PER SHARE PER YEAR, IT WILL TAKE 25 YEARS TO PAY YOU BACK, MEANING A PE OF $25/$1 = 25. 

ANOTHER THING, THE FAIR P/E IS DIFFERENT FOR DIFFERENT INDUSTRIES AND EVEN DIFFERENT COMPANIES IN THE SAME INDUSTRY. TECH USUALLY HAVE HIGHER P/E SINCE THE MARKET BELIEVES IT HAS HIGHER FUTURE GROWTH. 

&GT; THE REASON I PICKED THESE STOCKS IS THAT MY KNOWLEDGE IN STOCK MARKET IS NILL AND THEIR BALANCE SHEETS , FINANCIAL MOAT AND P/E RATIO’S ARE SOLID . SO MY STRATEGY IS THAT ANYTHING OF THESE ON A DISCOUNT IS A BARGAIN AS IT WILL EVENTUALLY REBOUND . 

MOST OF YOUR PICKS ARE VERY GOOD AND STRONG COMPANIES. MY WORRY IS THAT YOU HAVE TOO MANY INDIVIDUAL STOCKS AND YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE A HARD TIME FOLLOWING EACH AND EVERYONE OF THEM. SOMETIMES BECOMING MORE OF AN EXPERT IN A COUPLE STOCKS AND STICKING TO THEM CAN BE BETTER THAN BECOMING A MASTER OF NONE AND BUYING THEM ALL. IF YOU ARE GOING WITH THE SECOND ROUTE YOU COULD JUST PICK AN ETF LIKE THE SPY. I STILL BELIEVE STOCK PICKING IS BETTER, ESPECIALLY IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT. 

ANOTHER THING, MORE OF PRACTICAL THING THAN AN INVESTING ADVICE, ALL BROKERS IN CANADA CHARGE FEES PER TRANSACTIONS, BUY AND SELL, SO THE MORE SMALL TRANSACTIONS YOU MAKE, THE MORE YOU PAY IN FEE. THE ONLY EXCEPTION IS WEALTHSIMPLE TRADE WHICH HAS NO COMMISSION FEES, BUT THEY DO HAVE CONVERSION FEES FROM CAD TO USD AND VICE VERSA AND DON'T HAVE ANY ACCOUNT THAT CAN KEEP US DOLLARS.

1062,MushroomCake28,CanadianInvestor,"&GT; THESE OPTIONS SOUND TO ME LIKE SOLID INVESTMENTS THAT WILL RETURN MY MONEY FOR SURE IN 5 YEARS WITH A GOOD PROFIT? 

NO. HOW DID YOU PICK THOSE STOCKS? BEING A GOOD COMPANY WITH A GREAT BUSINESS DOESN'T MEAN IT'S A GREAT STOCK IF YOU BUY IT AT A PRICE THAT IS TOO HIGH. ALSO 5 YEARS IS A TOO SMALL TIME FRAME AND WON'T GUARANTEE YOU POSITIVE RETURNS, ESPECIALLY IN THIS CURRENT ENVIRONMENT. TAKE A LOOK AT 1929'S CHART, IT TOOK THE MARKET 25 YEARS TO RECOVER FROM THE FALL (WITHOUT DIVIDEND RE-INVESTED). THERE ARE RISKS THAT THIS DOWNTURN WILL TAKE A LONG TIME TO RECOVER, UNLIKE 2008-2009. THIS ISN'T JUST A VIRUS PROBLEM, IT'S A HEALTH PROBLEM THAT TRIGGERS A LIQUIDITY PROBLEM, WHICH TRIGGERS A DEBT PROBLEM. THIS ISN'T OVER YET, AND THE BOTTOM PROBABLY HASN'T BEEN REACHED AND WON'T BE REACHED IN THE NEAR TERM. TAKE A LOOK AT CHARTS OF PREVIOUS BEAR MARKETS, THERE ARE ALWAYS RALLIES INSIDE THEM WHICH GO BACK DOWN AND BREAKS THE LOWS, THEN BACK UP, THEN BACK DOWN TO BREAK THE LOWS AGAIN, ETC. 

DO YOU HAVE ANY FINANCIAL KNOWLEDGE? DO YOU KNOW WHAT A P/E RATIO IS?

MOST OF THE COMPANIES YOU LISTED ARE GREAT COMPANIES AND SOLID PICKS... IF YOU PICK THEM UP AT A DECENT PRICE. NO QUESTION ASKED FOR THE BANKS, THEY ARE A GREAT VALUE CURRENTLY. BUT TAKE TECH STOCKS FOR EXAMPLE, THEY ARE STILL HEAVILY OVERPRICED AND WILL LIKELY GO DOWN AND/OR STAGNANT IN THE NEAR TERM. APPLE FOR INSTANCE IS CURRENTLY SELLING AT A HIGHER PRICE THAN MOST OF ITS PRICES IN 2019. DO YOU THINK APPLE HAS THE SAME PROFITS AS 2019 OR EVEN MORE IN 2020? IF NOT, WHY WOULD YOU BUY APPLE AT A PRICE HIGHER (CURRENT PRICE, IT WILL PROBABLY GO DOWN AND BECOME A GOOD OPPORTUNITY IN THE FOLLOWING WEEKS/MONTHS) THAN IT WAS IN 2019?

THESE ARE CANADIAN $ ETFS (SO NO CURRENCY CONVERSION COSTS) THAT ARE CURRENCY HEDGED SO THAT FUTURE CHANGES IN THE US-CAD EXCHANGE RATE WON'T AFFECT YOU.

THE US ECONOMY HAS BEEN PRETTY HOT FOR A COUPLE DECADES BUT THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES WHERE OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD HAVE BEEN WHERE THE ACTION IS.

1106,dagoodnamesrtaken,CanadianInvestor,"A COUPLE OF THINGS.  I WORK AS A FINANCIAL PLANNER, I HOLD A BUNCH OF DESIGNATIONS ETC ETC.  DOES THIS MEAN YOU SHOULD TRUST ME?  NOT ALWAYS.  MAKE YOUR OWN JUDGEMENTS.

THE ADVICE I GIVE YOU HERE IS FAIRLY BASIC AND SINCE I AM TYPING QUICKLY WHILE WATCHING MY KIDS, DON'T INTEND TO PROOF READ ETC.

A FEW THINGS TO CONSIDER.

RISK HERE IS THAT YOU AREN'T ABLE TO OPEN UP YOUR OWN ACCOUNT DUE TO YOUR AGE.  THEREFORE, YOU WILL HAVE TO PUT MONEY INTO SOMEONE ELSE'S NAME.  PUTTING 10K OR 20K INTO SOMEONE ELSE'S NAME SOUNDS EASY AND LOW RISK (ASSUMING THESE ARE THE AMOUNTS WE ARE LOOKING AT), HOWEVER, IF THIS MONEY TURNS INTO 100K OR 200K OR 300K, DO YOU STILL FEEL GOOD?   I HAVE SEEN BOTH SIDES OF THE COIN WHEN IT COMES TO FAMILY FIGHTING/OR GETTING ALONG WITH MONEY.  YOU  HAVE TO COMPLETELY TRUST SIGNING FUNDS OVER TO SOMEONE ELSE, EVEN IF THEY ARE YOUR CHILDREN OR PARENTS.  PUTTING FUNDS INTO SOMEONE ELSE'S NAME NOT ONLY EXPOSES YOU TO THE RISK OF THAT PERSON, BUT IT EXPOSES YOU TO DIFFERENT ESTATE ISSUES IN CASE OF DEATH, IT EXPOSES YOU TO DIFFERENT LEGAL ISSUES IN CASE OF DIVORCE ETC.  IN THIS CASE, THE FUNDS DON'T SOUND LIKE AN EXTRAORDINARY LARGE AMOUNT, BUT THEY WOULD STILL BE EXPOSED TO THOSE RISKS.  THE FACT IS, THEY ARE VERY UNLIKELY TO GO AMEND A WILL OR BENEFICIARIES IN ORDER TO PROTECT YOU.  SETTING UP A FORMAL TRUST FOR A SMALLER AMOUNT OF MONEY IS TOO COSTLY, AND INFORMAL ONES ARE A PAIN IN THE BUTT AND DON'T ALWAYS PROTECT AS INTENDED.

I STATE THAT FIRST, BECAUSE YOU SHOULD ALWAYS THINK ABOUT THE OVERALL SITUATION.

THEREFORE, YOUR BEST BET IS AS FOLLOWS.

CHECK WITH YOUR PARENTS AND SEE IF THEY HAVE MAXED OUT THEIR TFSA (BOTH OF THEM?).  IF THEY HAVEN'T, AND I ASSUME THEY ALREADY HAVE ONE, GET THEM TO OPEN AN ADDITIONAL TFSA WHERE YOU ARE THE SOLE BENEFICIARY.  IF SOMETHING HAPPEN'S TO THEM, YOU WILL 'INHERIT' YOUR FUNDS BACK, PLUS ANY GROWTH OR LOSSES.  THIS WILL ALSO ELIMINATE YOUR TAXES AND WILL NOT ADD TAXATION TO THEM.  WITH THIS STRATEGY YOU ARE STILL EXPOSING YOURSELF TO THE RISKS ABOVE, BUT AT LEAST YOU ARE DEALING WITH YOUR PARENTS - WHICH SHOULD BE BETTER THAN A FRIEND OR A SIBLING (DUE TO POTENTIAL MARITAL PROBLEMS).  JUST BE AWARE THAT THIS DOES TAKE AWAY FROM THEIR POTENTIAL INVESTMENTS INTO THE TFSA (AS ALL ACCOUNTS ARE ADDED UP FOR CONTRIBUTION/WITHDRAWAL LIMIT PURPOSES).

ONCE YOU TURN OF LEGAL AGE, THEY CAN EITHER SLOWLY (6K PER YEAR) OR ALL AT ONCE SELL THE INVESTMENTS AND GIVE YOU THE CASH, AS WHICH POINT YOU WOULD INVEST IN YOUR OWN TFSA ACCOUNT AND FURTHER FUNDS INTO NON REGISTERED.  THE RISK HERE WOULD BE THAT YOU SELL ON A BAD DAY AND DUE TO 2/3 DAYS IT TAKES FOR FUNDS TO TRANSFER ETC. YOU COULD HAVE SOME OUT OF MARKET EXPOSURE, BUT THIS IS A MINOR AND LIKELY NOT TO COST YOU/EARN YOU MORE THAN 2% EITHER WAY.

IF THEY HAVE NO ROOM IN THEIR TFSA TO 'LEND YOU FOR TEMPORARY USE' THEN GET YOUR MOM OR DAD (WHOEVER IS IN A LOWER INCOME TAX BRACKET) TO OPEN A NON-REGISTERED ACCOUNT AND PURCHASE INVESTMENTS THERE.  ONCE YOU TURN OF LEGAL AGE, THEY CAN GIVE THOSE FUNDS BACK TO YOU (IT WILL TRIGGER CAPITAL GAINS OR LOSSES, DEPENDING ON THE PERFORMANCE).  IF YOU HAVE MINIMAL GAINS OR LOSSES, LIKELY BEST TO LIQUDATE THEN AND INVEST THEN IN YOUR OWN ACCOUNT (PAYING YOUR PARENTS BACK THE TAXES OWED - CALCULATE AT THAT TIME), AND IF YOU HAVE LARGER GAINS THEN YOU CAN STAGGER IT OVER A FEW YEARS IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE TAXES.

AS FAR AS WHAT YOU CAN INVEST IN, I WOULD KEEP IT FAIRLY SIMPLE.

A LITTLE SMALL WAY TO LOOK AT IT, NOT EXACT, BUT A FAIRLY DECENT WAY TO PREDICT.

$10,000, 25% STOCKS (IT WILL DROP BY 10%) 50% STOCKS (IT WILL DROP 20%), 75% STOCKS (IT WILL DROP 30%) AND 100% STOCKS (IT WILL DROP 40%).

IF YOU INVEST IN MORE VOLATILE INVESTMENTS THOSE NUMBERS CAN CHANGE BUT IT'S A VERY SIMPLE WAY TO EXPLAIN IT.  YOU CAN ADJUST THOSE 10/20/30/40 TO EVEN HIGHER AND SAY, 12/24/36/48% DROP ETC.  IF YOU'D LIKE TO GO FURTHER YOU CAN SAY 15/30/45/60% DROP IN YOUR MONEY IF THE MARKET CRASHES.  WE ARE CURRENTLY SEEING EXTREME DROP IN THE MARKETS AND NOBODY REALLY KNOWS WHERE THE BOTTOM IS.  SO YOU HAVE TO BE PREPARED THAT IF YOU ARE BUYING APPLE STOCK THAT MAYBE THIS HAS DROPPED AS FAR AS IT WILL, OR IT COULD KEEP DROPPING FURTHER.

THE KEY IS TO SET YOURSELF A HOW MUCH RISK CAN I TAKE?  IF MY 10,000 DROPS TO 7,500 AM I STILL OK? WHAT IF IT DROPS TO $3,000?  YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE BUYING SOLID LONG TERM INVESTMENTS THAT WILL REBOUND AND THIS MIGHT TAKE YEARS.  SO THAT BRINGS TO LAST POINT, YOU NEED TO BE COMMITTED AND NOT REQUIRE THESE FUNDS IN 2/3 YEARS, BECAUSE IT MIGHT TAKE MUCH LONGER FOR YOUR FUNDS TO COME BACK.  THAT'S WHY I DON'T RECOMMEND BUYING A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT STOCKS, YOU SHOULD SPREAD THE RISK.

FOR THE US MARKETS YOU CAN PURCHASE VOO - WHICH IS BASICALLY S&AMP;P 500 INDEX AT AN EXTREMELY LOW MER (I BELEIVE .03%).  ANY OF THE OTHER S&AMP;P 500 WOULD WORK THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO PURCHASE IN CANADA.  YOU CAN ALSO PURCHASE ANY OF THE OTHER S&AMP;P INDEX OFFERINGS

FOR ANY CANADIAN HOLDINGS (BEING SO YOUNG I WOULD LET PORTFOLIO MANAGERS HANDLE YOUR INVESTMENTS OR GO WITH AN INDEX SUCH AS  - SO CHECK OUT MARK SCHMELL AT FIDELITY, GLOBAL INNOVATORS FUND, SPECIAL SITUATIONS OR CANADIAN GROWTH COMPANY AS THEY WILL OUTPERFORM THE TSX CANADIAN INDEX.)  EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE A 'HIGH' MER THEY ARE STILL GOING TO OUTPERFORM AFTER FEES AND ADD VALUE FOR THEIR FEES.  SOME OTHER COMPANIES TO CONSIDER ARE EDGEPOINT PORTFOLIOS AND/OR CAPITAL GROUP GLOBAL EQUITY.  THESE ARE ALL MUTUAL FUNDS WITH TREMENDOUS MANAGERS AND INCREDIBLE PERFORMANCE.

ALL TRADING PLATFORMS WILL GIVE YOU RECOMMENDED FUNDS (AND MOST OF THESE ARE EXTREMELY HIGHLY RATED BY INDEPENDENTS LIKE MORNING STAR)

IF YOU WISH TO BUY INDIVIDUAL STOCKS - I WOULD MAKE SURE THAT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE BUYING.  UNDERSTAND THOSE BUSINESS AND READ READ READ AS MUCH ANALYSIS (NUMBERS) AS YOU CAN.  PLACES LIKE REDDIT ARE GREAT FOR BASIC ADVICE SUCH AS I JUST GAVE YOU, BUT YOU WILL NEED TO EDUCATE YOURSELF FOR INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES A LOT MORE.

IF YOU ARE REALLY INTERESTED IN GETTING A GOOD START, GETTING READING MATERIALS ETC. I WOULD LOOK AT READING MATERIALS FROM THE CANADIAN SECURITIES COURSE WHICH WILL GIVE YOU A GOOD BASE ON REGULATIONS AND CONCEPTS.  I AM NOT SURE THAT YOU ARE ABLE TO SIGN UP FOR IT, BUT MAYBE YOU CAN PURCHASE USED BOOKS ON KIJIJI OR GET THEM AT A LIBRARY.

1109,mnkb99,CanadianInvestor,"I USED TO THINK THE SAME THING HONESTLY, HOWEVER I RECENTLY STOPPED TO REALLY TRY AND THINK ABOUT WHAT MAKES APPLE ONE OF THE MOST VALUABLE COMPANIES IN THE WORLD. I MEAN, IT CAN'T \_ACTUALLY\_ ONLY BE PEOPLE CHASING THE LATEST PHONES EVERY YEAR, RIGHT?

FIRST OF ALL, APPLE IS GENUINELY EXTREMELY INNOVATIVE, AND THEY ARE A TREND SETTER. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT, THEY LITERALLY INVENTED THE SMARTPHONE. THEN, LOOK AT THEIR AIRPODS, YEAH WIRELESS HEADPHONES WERE ALREADY TRENDING BEFORE AIRPODS, BUT THEY ABSOLUTELY EXPLODED WHEN APPLE CAME OUT WITH AIRPODS. 

I WAS WALKING FROM UNION TO MY WORK ONE DAY, AND I TRIED COUNTING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WEARING AIRPODS VS WEARING ANYTHING ELSE, AND IN A 20 MINUTE WALK IT WAS ABOUT 50/50 COUNTING ROUGHLY 120 PEOPLE. 

ANOTHER THING I REALIZED IS THAT I HAD AN AVERSION FOR APPLE PRODUCTS EVEN THOUGH I'VE NEVER USED THEM BEFORE, EXACTLY BECAUSE I ONLY THOUGHT THEY WERE OVERPRICED PIECES OF GARBAGE. I ONLY EVER USED ANDROID PHONES, WINDOWS AND LINUX PCS. BUT THEN I STARTED WORKING AT A COMPANY THAT ONLY USES MACBOOKS AND REALIZED HOW INCREDIBLE USER EXPERIENCE IN THE APPLE ECOSYSTEM REALLY IS. HONESTLY I NEVER EVEN CONSIDERED BUYING A MACBOOK BECAUSE OF THEIR RIDICULOUS PRICE, BUT NOW I GENUINELY DREAD OPENING MY HOME LAPTOP TO DO ANY DEVELOPMENT WORK, AND I DON'T HAVE A SHITTY LAPTOP! I DON'T HAVE ANY EXPERIENCE WITH AN IPHONE BUT THIS IS MY 2 CENTS WHEN IT COMES TO MAC. 

AND FINALLY ADDING TO THIS FROM A PURELY INVESTMENT PERSPECTIVE - EVERY SINGLE COMPANY IN THE WORLD NEEDS TO DO MARKETING AND APPLE IS NO EXCEPTION. I THINK IF THEIR MARKETING IS WORKING BETTER THAN MOST OTHER COMPANIES, THEN THAT'S JUST ONE MORE REASON TO INVEST IN THEM, BECAUSE THEY ACTUALLY KNOW HOW TO SPEND MONEY ON MARKETING. WOULDN'T IT BE FAR WORSE INVESTING IN A COMPANY THAT SPENDS THE SAME AMOUNT OF MONEY AND YIELDS FAR WORSE RESULTS?

THANKS FOR THE FEEDBACK! I'M A INVESTOR WHO'S NEW TO THE MARKET.

MY INVESTMENT STRATEGY ISN'T NECESSARILY TO BEAT THE MARKET, I DON'T CARE IF I BEAT IT OR NOT, MY MAIN PRIORITY IS TO ""NOT LOSE MONEY"". BASICALLY LIMITING MY RISK EXPOSURE WHILE EXTRACTING MAXIMUM VALUE. ALL MY INVESTMENT HAVE LOW RISK EXPOSURE IF YOU DELVE INTO IT.

I WOULD LOVE TO ADD TO MY APPLE HOLDINGS SHOULD THE PRICE DROP SIGNIFICANTLY. I'M NOT ADDING RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S WORTH IT AT THE MOMENT. THEY ARE A FANTASTIC BUSINESS ONCE YOU DIVE INTO IT EVEN THOUGH I'M ANDROID PERSON MYSELF. THEY HAVE SO MUCH COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES THAT IT'S VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR OTHERS TO BEAT. THE BEST ADVANTAGE IS THEY HAVE MONOPOLY ON IOS USERS AND CAN THEREFORE CHARGE A PREMIUM AND LOCK THEM INTO THEIR ECOSYSTEM. ESPECIALLY THE OLDER FOLKS WANT SOMETHING EASY AND FAMILIAR TO USE, IT'S PRETTY STABLE SHORT OF A TECHNOLOGICAL SHIFT AWAY FROM MOBILE. EVEN THEN, WITH THEIR CASH PILE, THEY CAN BUY THEIR WAY INTO ANY EMERGING THREATS IF THEY MISS THE BOAT ON ANYTHING IMPORTANT. MY AVG COST IS LESS THAN 200.


BAIDU IS FANTASTIC BECAUSE THEY HAVE TREMENDOUS UPSIDE WITH THE SHIFT INTO ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE AS THEIR CORE BUSINESS (WHICH I BELIEVE WILL HAVE A BIGGER IMPACT ON MANKIND THAN THE SMARTPHONE OR THE INTERNET ITSELF)  WHILE THE DOWNSIDE IS NOW GREATLY LIMITED DUE TO THEIR PULLBACKS IN VALUATION. MY ONLY REAL CONCERN IS IT BEING A CHINA STOCK AND THUS HAVE ASSIGN IT A PREMIUM TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT RISK, OTHERWISE IT IS JUST BRILLANT EQUITY LONG TERM. I ACQUIRE MY SHARES VERY RECENTLY AT LOW PRICE SO MY DOWNSIDE IS HIGHLY LIMITED HERE. A LEADING TECHNOLOGY GROWTH COMPANY VALUED AT 2X BOOK VALUE - WHICH IS LESS THAN MANY BORING VALUE STOCK?

HERE'S MY STORY ABOUT APPLE IN CHINA:

SO MY GRANDMA WAS AN OFFICER IN THE CHINESE ARMY. SHE'S RETIRED AND LIVED OFF A PENSION. WE USED TO HAVE A 20 YR OLD CARETAKER. SHE'S GOT ONLY GRADE 6 EDUCATION. AND SHE MOVED TO MY GRANDMA'S CITY WHEN SHE'S 16. SHE FOUND A JOB AT ONE OF THE APPLE'S CONTRACTING FACTORY. THAT FACTORY OFFERED $80 USD/MONTH (90'S CURRENCY) AND 3 MEALS A DAY, AND FREE ACCOMMODATION.

GREAT. THEN THERE CAME A MONTH SHE NOTICED EVERYBODY AROUND HER WAS ""TURNING"" YELLOW. NOT BEING RACIST ABOUT CHINESE PEOPLE. BUT EVERYONE'S INDEED TURNING ""YELLOW"".

TURNED OUT THERE'S A HEP B OUTBREAK AT THAT APPLE'S FACTORY THAT OFFERED 3 MEALS/DAY. IT WENT SO BAD THAT THE PROVINCIAL GOVERNMENT HAD TO SHUT THE FACTORY DOWN, AND QUARANTINED EVERYBODY - BY THROWING THEM INTO GOVERNMENT-RAN PRISON CAMPS WITH THE INMATES - WORKING WITHOUT PAID - EVEN WORSE.

THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A GROWTH BY ACQUISITION MODEL DOESNT WORK OUT. MOST OF ETFS GOT OUT AND MANAGEMENT ALREADY ANNOUNCED A DIVIDEND CUT TO PRESERVE CASH. LOOKING AT P/B, P/S AND EVEN D/E THEY ARENT REALLY FLASHING HUGE RED LIGHTS TO ME. PERHAPS DUE TO THE DEPRECIATED SHARE PRICE.

THIS COMPANY HAS MAJOR STAKES IN 8 HOSPITALS, ALL IN THE US. 3 HOSPITALS ARE SHOWING HEALTHY REVENUE GROWTH BUT 1 HOSPITAL'S (**UMASH**) STEEP DECLINE CAUSED TOTAL YTD REVENUE TO FALL BELOW 2018'S. OPERATING EXPENSE IS HIT HARD BY GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT FOR TWO CONSECUTIVE QUARTERS. BUT THIS LINE DOESN'T AFFECT CASH.

EARNINGS IN A FEW DAYS. I THINK THERE IS VALUE IN THIS STOCK BUT I WONT FULLY COMMIT UNTIL SEEING REVENUE GROWTH. 
OPTIONS OR DEBENTURES AREN'T TRADABLE WITH THIS ONE. DON'T INVEST IN THIS STOCK IF SPECULATION ISN'T YOUR APPETITE.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BELOW IS COMMENTARY OF REVENUE FROM 8 HOSPITALS (FROM QUARTERLY REPORT). **UMASH** IS THE BAD APPLE WITH 47% DECREASE IN REVENUE. IT IS STRUGGLING TO KEEP UP HIGH MARGIN SURGERIES WHILE LOW MARGIN VOLUME INCREASING.

• ASH’S REVENUE DECREASED MAINLY DUE TO PAYOR MIX, AS WELL AS CASE MIX BECAUSE OF FEWER HIGH ACUITY CASES, PARTLY OFFSET BY HIGHER CASE VOLUMES.  

• **UMASH’S** REVENUE DECREASED MAINLY DUE TO PAYOR MIX AS COMMERCIAL PAYORS WERE DOWN WHILE MEDICARE AND SIMILAR PAYORS WERE UP, AND CASE MIX, AS OUTPATIENT CASES WITH LOWER ACUITY INCREASED WHILE INPATIENT SPINE CASES DECLINED, PARTLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SURGICAL CASE VOLUMES WHICH WERE UP BY 14.9%. 

• OSH’S REVENUE INCREASED MAINLY DUE TO HIGHER SURGICAL AND PAIN CASE VOLUMES, PARTLY OFFSET BY PAYOR MIX DUE TO INCREASED MEDICARE AND SIMILAR PAYORS. 

• BHSH’S REVENUE INCREASED MAINLY DUE TO CASE MIX, INCREASED URGENT CARE REVENUE, AND HIGHER SURGICAL CASE VOLUMES, PARTLY OFFSET BY PAYOR MIX, IN WHICH MEDICARE AND SIMILAR PAYORS WERE UP. 

• SFSH’S REVENUE INCREASED MAINLY DUE TO CASE MIX AS ORTHOPEDIC AND ORTHOPEDIC SPINE CASES INCREASED, AND HIGHER CASE VOLUMES, PARTLY OFFSET BY PAYOR MIX AND HIGHER BAD DEBT EXPENSES. 

• SCNC’S REVENUE DECREASED MAINLY DUE TO PAYOR MIX COMBINED WITH LOWER CASE VOLUMES. 

• MFC NUETERRA ASCS’ REVENUE DECREASED MAINLY DUE TO CASE MIX AND LOWER CASE VOLUMES AT TWO RIVERS AMBULATORY SURGERY CENTER.

ON THE OTHER HAND, MAYBE I’M JUST BIASED AS A TECH WORKER, BUT THE FACT THAT OTHER AUTOMAKERS HAVE BEEN SO BEHIND AND OUTRIGHT STAGNANT IN THEIR TECH MAKES ME THINK THEY STILL DON’T GET IT.

YOU SPEND 50-70K ON A CAR FROM A COMPETITOR, OR EVEN MUCH MORE, AND YOU STILL GET LOW RESOLUTION DISPLAYS, LAGGY UIS, AND VERY LIMITED IN WHAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY DO, ALL BEING RUN BY A CPU THAT’S WORSE THAN WHAT YOU’D PUT IN A $100 CELL PHONE. 

TESLA IS BLOWING THEM OUT OF THE WATER WITH TECH THAT’S COMMONLY AVAILABLE, AND REASONABLY PRICED EVEN AT THE CONSUMER LEVEL.

HELL THAT’S WHY CARPLAY IS SUCH A BIG DEAL NOWADAYS, BECAUSE AFTER DOING INFOTAINMENT TERRIBLY FOR DECADES, AND BEING THE PEOPLE WHO DESIGNED THE CAR FROM THE GROUND UP, THEY’RE STILL BESTED BY SIMPLY BECOMING A DUMB SCREEN AND LETTING A PHONE HANDLE THE PROCESSING, AND LETTING APPLE HANDLE THE UI. THE OTHER CAR MAKERS JUST AREN’T TRYING. 

I’D BOLT IT ONTO MY OWN CAR IF I COULD FIND A TIDY WAY TO INTEGRATE IT, AND HAVE IT ALL COMMUNICATE.

1189,hinault81,CanadianInvestor,"30% BONDS/CASH. I WOULD HOLD IT ALL BONDS BUT I JUST DON'T FULLY TRUST BOND ETFS. PLUS A COMPLETELY SEPARATE 12 MONTHS EMERGENCY FUND, BUT I DON'T COUNT THIS AS MONEY FOR INVESTING, IT JUST SITS IN A HISA. 

AT THE END OF THE DAY YOU HAVE TO LIVE WITH YOURSELF, AND EVERYONE'S CIRCUMSTANCES ARE DIFFERENT. WHEN MY PORTFOLIO WAS SMALLER BEING ALMOST 100% INVESTED DIDN'T FEEL LIKE A BIG DEAL BECAUSE EVEN IF THINGS WERE CUT TO 50-60% I WAS PUTTING IN SO MUCH MONEY COMPARED TO WHAT WAS IN THERE. AS IT'S GOTTEN SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER I'VE GROWN A BIT MORE CONSERVATIVE AND WANT SOME CASH AND BONDS. POSSIBLY FOR A CORRECTION: DEC 2018 PEOPLE ON HERE SEEMED TO BE THINKING THE WORLD WAS ENDING BECAUSE THEIR PORTFOLIOS WERE ALL IN RED, MEANWHILE I WAS BUYING APPLE AT $150 OR SO. 

BUT THAT'S NOT MY PRIMARY REASON. IT'S MAINLY SO I CAN BE COMFORTABLE IN WHATEVER MARKET WE HAVE. I REALIZE YOU'RE NOT SUPPOSED TO INVEST ANYTHING YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TOUCH FOR 10 YEARS, BUT LIFE IS TOO UNPREDICTABLE FOR THAT. 7 YEARS AGO I WAS LIVING PAYCHEQUE TO PAYCHEQUE AND WORKING UNTIL I WAS 100. BUT WITH SOME SIZEABLE SAVINGS THERE ARE OTHER ALTERNATIVES NOW, SUCH AS TAKE A YEAR OFF, ETC. I HAVE A NEW LARGER HOUSE (MORTGAGE) AND I FEEL A BIT MORE EXPOSED VS MY LAST PLACE WHICH I COULD'VE PAID DOWN ANYTIME.  SO THAT INVESTED MONEY MIGHT NOT BE NEEDED FOR 20 YEARS, BUT IT MAY BE NEEDED NEXT YEAR. WHO KNOWS. MAYBE I SHOULDN'T HAVE IT IN MY RRSP OR TFSA, BUT I DON'T REALLY HAVE ANYWHERE TO KEEP IT. AND HOLDING IT IN THERE KEEPS ME FROM SPENDING IT ON SOMETHING ELSE. AND I'M PREPARED TO USE THAT 30% TO INVEST IF WANTED. 

I THINK IT'S JUST DIFFERENT FOR EVERYONE. I THINK THE WRONG THING FOR SOMEONE TO DO IS FEEL PRESSURED TO BE OVEREXPOSED (BECAUSE STOCKS ALWAYS OUTPERFORM LONG TERM!)

CONSIDER THOUGH IF/HOW YOU WANT CURRENCY/EXCHANGE RATE EXPOSURE. YOU CAN BUY AN ETF IN CAD, BUT THAT ETF WILL HOLD US STOCKS IN USD. 

AN EXAMPLE OF THIS ARE THE BMO NASDAQ 100 ETFS. IF YOU BUY ZNQ YOU GET THE NASDAQ 100 COMPANIES (IE TOP 5 HOLDINGS ARE  APPLE, MICROSOFT, AMAZON, FACEBOOK, GOOGLE).

BUT A VERY DIVERSIFIED TECHNOLOGY ETF, WHICH HOLDS HUNDREDS OF TECH COMPANIES (FROM SOFTWARE, TO HARDWARE, TO WHATEVER ELSE), SHOULD BE RELATIVELY IMMUNE FROM THOSE TYPES OF RISKS THAT YOU MENTIONED; IF SOME OF THOSE COMPANIES IN IT FAIL, THE ETF MANAGER CAN REMOVE THEM FROM THE ETF HOLDINGS AND REPLACE THEM WITH BETTER-PERFORMING ONES (OR, IF THE TECHNOLOGY ETF IS MIRRORING AN INDEX, THEN AS COMPANIES FAIL, THEY WILL BE REMOVED FROM THE INDEX AND THE INDEX WILL REPLACE THEM WITH BETTER-PERFORMING COMPANIES).

ANYWAY, YOUR POINT IS WELL-TAKEN ABOUT NOT PUTTING ALL YOUR EGGS IN ONE SECTOR BASKET, EVEN THE TECHNOLOGY SECTOR.
