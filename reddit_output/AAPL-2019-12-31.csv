1,imgram,CanadianInvestor,"GOING TO GO AGAINST THE GRAIN OF THE RETAIL INVESTING CONSENSUS AND SAY RIDESHARING. 

I LIKE TO PICK SOME SECURITIES WHERE I BELIEVE THE MARKET THESIS IS INCORRECT. FOR INSTANCE, WHEN AAPL DEVALUED LAST YEAR BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT DECLINING UNIT SALES BUT IGNORING THE LIFETIME VALUE OF THE CUSTOMER THAT COMES WITH SERVICES AND WEARABLES.

THE GENERAL CONSENSUS AMONG A LOT OF INVESTORS SEEMS TO BE THAT RIDESHARING (LYFT/UBER) IS LOSING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND HAVE NO PATH TO PROFITABILITY. WHERE I THINK PEOPLE ARE UNDERESTIMATING THE TWO COMPANIES IS THE ELEVATED SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION THAT OCCURS WITH ANY IPO. DEPENDING ON HOW YOU WANT TO ADJUST OR NORMALIZE FOR THAT, I'D PEG THE BUSINESSES AT ROUGHLY A -25% OPERATING MARGIN WHICH ADMITTEDLY IS PRETTY BAD. HOWEVER, WITH TAKE-RATES IN THE ~20-25% RANGE, IF THEY ARE ABLE TO INCREASE PRICES BY ~5% (EITHER THROUGH HIGH PRICES/LOWER PROMOTIONS), THIS GETS THEM TO ROUGHLY BREAK-EVEN WHEN ELEVATED NEAR-TERM SBC IS ADJUSTED FOR. 

WHETHER THIS OCCURS OR NOT IS ANYONE'S GUESS BUT IF THE COMPANIES ADOPT A PRICE LEADER, PRICE FOLLOWER DYNAMIC, THE ROAD TO PROFITABILITY WILL BE CLEAR BY THE END OF 2020 AND I THINK THE SHARES WILL RE-RATE UP. AS FAR AS I CAN TELL, MANAGEMENT SEEMS TO BE SIGNALLING THAT PROFITABILITY IS IMPORTANT BUT THE MARKET IS LARGELY UNCONVINCED RIGHT NOW. IF YOU VIEW THE MARKET DYNAMICS OF RIDE SHARE THROUGH THE LENS OF THE RULE OF 3, BOTH UBER AND LYFT BENEFIT FROM NO LONGER TRYING TO CAPTURE MORE MARKET SHARE BUT STARTING TO RATIONALIZE PRICING.",fb70o8i,t3_ebgngo,1576568001,1576593201.0,/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/ebgngo/2020_picks/fb70o8i/

8,hokageace,CanadianInvestor,"I WILL START BY SAYING YOU SHOULD NOT MAKE SERIOUS INVESTMENT DECISIONS BASED ON ADVICE GIVEN BY STRANGERS ONLINE.

THAT SAID...

THIS IS NOT AN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY, HOW MUCH DO YOU KNOW ABOUT INVESTMENTS? IF NOT MUCH THEN VERY IMPRESSIVE BECAUSE YOU COULD DO A LOT WORSE. 

YOU SHOULD TALK TO SOME FINANCIAL ADVISORS AS YOU ARE CLOSE TO THE FUNDS THEY TAKE ON IF YOU DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT INVESTING. I AM TALKING ABOUT THOSE WHO CAN PROVIDE ADVICE ON INDIVIDUAL STOCKS AND NOT YOUR AVERAGE BANK ONE WHICH CAN ONLY SELL YOU MUTUAL FUNDS. IF YOU GO THIS ROUTE, WATCH OUT FOR FEES AS I DON'T THINK ANYTHING HIGHER THAN 1-1.2% IS WORTH IT.

IF YOU STILL WANT TO GO AT IT INDIVIDUALLY....STUDY AND EDUCATE YOURSELF BUT HERE ARE SOME THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND.

FIRST IS POSITION SIZING. CONVENTIONAL WISDOM SAYS YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE MORE THAN 7% IN AN INDIVIDUAL STOCK TO REDUCE SINGLE STOCK RISK UNLESS YOU ARE A PRO. ETFS DO NOT COUNT. I WOULD DEFINATELY REDUCE TD SIGNIFICANTLY AND ALL OTHERS TO 7% OR 10% AT MOST.

VFV IS A VERY GOOD ETF AND YOU WOULD NOT GO WRONG IF IT'S 100% OF YOUR PORTFOLIO. YOU WOULD PROBABLY OUTPERFORM MOST ADVISORS WITH JUST THAT. HOWEVER, YOU SHOULD LOOK AT GETTING THE US VERSION LISTED ON A US EXCHANGE IN USD. I BELIEVE USD IS A BETTER CURRENCY LONG TERM (LOOK UP NORBERT'S GAMBIT FOR EXCHANGE) AND IF YOU HOLD IT IN AN A NON-REGISTERED ACCOUNT OR TFSA, THERE ARE TAX IMPACTS ON CANADIAN LISTED ONES. I WOULD ALSO PICK VTI BECAUSE IT'S ALL MARKET AND VFV IS ABOUT 80% OF MARKET AND DOES NOT HAVE SMALLER COMPANIES WHICH HISTORICALLY OUTPERFORM.

I WOULD GET RID OF THE BOND INDEX SIMPLY DUE TO YOUR TIME HORIZON. I WOULD SAY START TO THINK ABOUT BONDS AT 10 YEARS FROM RETIREMENT OR WHEN YOU NEED TO ACCESS THE FUNDS.

I WOULD GET RID OF THE BAM SUB AND JUST KEEP BAM. IT IS A SUPERIOR INVESTMENT.

REST OF STOCKS ARE GREAT. I WOULD LOOK AT AQN AND ATD.B AS WELL IN CANADA. GREAT CHOICE WITH NOT GETTING A CANADIAN ETF BECAUSE THEY ARE FULL OF GARBAGE IN ENERGY AND NATURAL RESOURCES.

50,ZivSerb,CanadianInvestor,"NO NO, CIBC DID CHARGE ME WHT IN MY TFSA WHEN HOLDING A US DIVIDEND-PAYING EQUITY. I HELD XLF AND AAPL FOR A LARGE CHUNK OF LAST YEAR AND THE WITHHOLDING TAX (15%) WAS DEDUCTED UPON EACH DIVIDEND PAYMENT. SORRY IF THE WORDING WAS CONFUSING. 

THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE IN AN RRSP, IT JUST MAKES MORE SENSE TO HAVE THEM IN AN RRSP TO AVOID THE WITHHOLDING TAX YOU'D BE SUBJECTED TO IF THEY WERE IN A TFSA. 

HONESTLY THE QUESTION ABOUT WHICH BROKER HAS BEEN ONE THAT I'VE BEEN GRAPPLING WITH FOR THE BETTER PART OF A YEAR. FOR TFSA/RRSP, I FEEL RBC AND TD ARE BOTH SOLID BANKS. TD HAS PRETTY DECENT CUSTOMER SUPPORT AND YOU GAIN ACCESS TO THINK OR SWIM WHICH IS A GREAT SOLID CHARTING/TRADING PLATFORM. RBC AT LEAST OFFERS PAPER TRADING WHICH IS NICE. CIBC DOES NOT OR AT LEAST I HAVEN'T FOUND IT IF THEY DO IN TFSA/RRSP INVESTOR'S EDGE ACCOUNTS. THEY OFFER THE MOST COMPETITIVE COMMISSION RATES, BUT IF YOU DON'T PLAN ON PUTTING IN A LOT OF TRADES THEN THAT'S SOMEWHAT INCONSEQUENTIAL. THEIR FILLS ARE REALLY GOOD THOUGH, ALWAYS PRETTY CONTENT WITH THE SPEED AND PRICE AT WHICH THEY FILL ORDERS. HOWEVER, THEY'RE SHIT IN THE SENSE THAT THEY DON'T ALLOW STOPS AND LIMITS ON THE SAME EQUITY. FOR EXAMPLE, IF I WANT TOSS A STOP ON BNS @ $70 BUT ALSO PUT IN A LIMIT AT $75 I CAN'T HAVE BOTH OF THOSE ORDERS OPEN AT THE SAME TIME AS IT SAYS THE ""QUANTITY IS UNAVAILABLE"". CIBC'S UI IS ANTIQUATED AF. I DO MOST OF MY TRADING THROUGH IB OR TC2000 BUT I'D PERSONALLY SUGGEST TD BECAUSE FROM MY EXPERIENCE TOS IS ALSO VERY NICE. THERE ARE STIPULATIONS TO GETTING REAL-TIME DATA BUT THOSE ARE CLEARLY OUTLINED ON THEIR SITE :).

52,Thefailedbagel,CanadianInvestor,"1. I FOLLOW THE ADVICE BUT HAVE A SMALL ACTIVE PORTFOLIO FOR FUN (I MAJORED IN FINANCE AND FIND INVESTMENTS TO BE FASCINATING) 

2. ARROGANCE, BUT FOR ME THERE ARE A FEW THINGS:
A) I THINK IT WOULD BE INCREDIBLY STUPID TO BELIEVE I HAVE BETTER KNOWLEDGE ON MSFT, AAPL OR TD, RBC OVER INVESTMENT PROFESSIONALS. YET I DOUBT THE COMBINED PROFESSIONALS HAVE FOUND THE PERFECT PRICE FOR YOUR RANDOM CANADIAN STOCK ON THE TSX NO ONE OUTSIDE OF CANADA HAS EVER HEARD OF. 

B) I'M NOT DOING THIS FOR A LIVING, ONLY A FEW TRADES A YEAR ON STUFF I RESEARCHED AND TRULY BELIEVE IN MY ASSUMPTIONS/THESIS. MOST COMPANIES I HAVE BROUGHT ARE ONES I'M COMFORTABLE WITH BUYING AND HOLDING, MAYBE AT THE END I DON'T ""BEAT THE MARKET"" BUT A GAIN IS STILL A GAIN. 

C) THIS IS TOTALLY ON THE SIDE, I WAS PASSIVE UNTIL LAST YEAR BUT HAVE OUTPERFORMED THE MARKET. WITHOUT PUTTING SOME $$ WHERE MY MOUTH IS, I CAN NEVER SEE IF MY IDEAS ARE CORRECT OR NOT. MY BIGGEST FRUSTRATION IS EVEN IF I'M CURRENTLY BEATING THE MARKET, I HAVE NO IDEA IF THIS IS BLIND LUCK.

THE PRICE OF A STOCK/ETF IN THE FUTURE IS IRRELEVANT: THE PRICE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT YOU BOUGHT AND SOLD IS IMPORTANT, PLUS PERHAPS DIVIDENDS (IF ANY).

AAPL IS CURRENTLY ABOUT US$150. I BOUGHT AAPL MANY YEARS AGO AT ABOUT $90, IT WENT UP TO $500 (MY RIMM DIDN'T DO AS WELL); I SOLD. IT WENT UP TO ABOUT $600, THEN THEY DID A 1:6 SPLIT AND IT ""WENT TO"" $100 AGAIN, RISING TO ITS CURRENT $150.

OF COURSE WHEN I HELD IT THERE WERE NO DIVIDENDS, AND THERE ARE NOW. SO EVEN IF A STOCK IS $X, AND IT STAYS AT $X FOR TEN YEARS, IF YOU'RE GETTING DIVIDENDS YOU CAN STILL MAKE MONEY FROM IT.
