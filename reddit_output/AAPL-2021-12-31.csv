19,LockStockandTendies,CanadianInvestor,"I'D ALSO JUST LIKE TO ADD THAT EVEN THOUGH YOU MAY BE STARTING WITH 1,000, I'D PERSONALLY TRY TO STILL PRACTICE DIVERSIFICATION! TRY TO GET AT LEAST 20 DIFFERENT HOLDINGS IF YOU CAN (NO MORE THAN 10% OF YOUR PORTFOLIO IN ANY PARTICULAR HOLDING). DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE OF GOING ALL IN ON ONE STOCK OR ONE SECTOR. THAT COULD GIVE YOU MORE GAINS, BUT AT THE SAME TIME, YOU COULD PICK WRONG AND THAT ONE DECISION COULD MAKE YOUR 1,000 EVAPORATE (WHICH ISN'T THE END OF THE WORLD), BUT WHAT'S MORE DAMAGING IS THAT IT CAN REALLY TURN YOU OFF TO INVESTING FOR THE FUTURE. OR, IT COULD MAKE YOU WAY TOO OVERCONFIDENT IF YOU GUESS CORRECTLY END THEN YOU MIGHT ALL-IN WITH MORE MONEY IN THE FUTURE AND POTENTIALLY LOSE AN EVEN LARGER AMOUNT.

LASTLY, I WANT TO ADD: DON'T MAKE THE SIMPLE MISTAKE OF THINKING THAT A STOCK PRICE PER SHARE HAS ANY INDICATION ON HOW EXPENSIVE THE STOCK IS. COMPANIES HAVE GREATLY DIFFERENT QUANTITIES OF SHARES COMPARATIVE TO ONE ANOTHER. INSTEAD, COMPARE MARKET CAPS (SHARE PRICE X SHARES OUTSTANDING) ONE GREAT EXAMPLE WOULD BE AMZN AT A SHARE PRICE OF 3400 IS ACTUALLY CHEAPER THAN AAPL WITH A SHARE PRICE OF 170.

&GT; BEFORE I CONTINUE, LET ME CLARIFY: WHEN I SAY DIVIDENDS ARE IRRELEVANT, I DO NOT MEAN THEY ARE UNIMPORTANT TO TOTAL RETURNS. THEY ARE IMPORTANT. WHAT I MEAN, IS THEY ARE IRRELEVANT IN DETERMINING *WHICH* STOCKS MAY HAVE GOOD FUTURE RETURNS.

* HTTPS://WWW.PWLCAPITAL.COM/THE-IRRELEVANCE-OF-DIVIDENDS-STILL-A-NON-STARTER/

AMZN HAS NEVER PAID DIVIDENDS (AND TECHNICALLY DIDN'T MAKE A PROFIT FOR A FEW DECADES): WOULD ANYONE SAY THEY ARE / WERE A BAD INVESTMENT? AAPL STOPPED PAYING THEM IN THE 1990S WHEN IT WAS ON THE ROPES: HOW MANY FOLKS WOULD HAVE *LOVED* TO ACTUALLY BUY AAPL AT THAT TIME?

AND PLENTY OF COMPANIES THAT PAID DIVIDENDS DIDN'T DO SO WELL: THE GREATEST EXAMPLE IS/WAS ENRON.

*JUST BECAUSE* A COMPANY PAYS DIVIDENDS DOES NOT *NECESSARILY* MEAN THAT YOU WOULD WANT TO INVEST IN THEM.

FURTHER, IF YOU LOOK AT *ONLY* COMPANIES THAT PAY DIVIDENDS, YOU ARE LIMITING YOUR DIVERSIFICATION. THIS IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE MOST STOCKS SUCK:

&GT; WE STUDY LONG-RUN SHAREHOLDER OUTCOMES FOR OVER 64,000 GLOBAL COMMON STOCKS DURING THE JANUARY 1990 TO DECEMBER 2020 PERIOD. WE DOCUMENT THAT THE MAJORITY, 55.2% OF U.S. STOCKS AND 57.4% OF NON-U.S. STOCKS, UNDERPERFORM ONE-MONTH U.S. TREASURY BILLS IN TERMS OF COMPOUND RETURNS OVER THE FULL SAMPLE. FOCUSING ON AGGREGATE SHAREHOLDER OUTCOMES, WE FIND THAT THE TOP-PERFORMING **2.4% OF FIRMS** ACCOUNT FOR ALL OF THE $US 75.7 TRILLION IN NET GLOBAL STOCK MARKET WEALTH CREATION FROM 1990 TO DECEMBER 2020. OUTSIDE THE US, **1.41% OF FIRMS** ACCOUNT FOR THE $US 30.7 TRILLION IN NET WEALTH CREATION.

* HTTPS://PAPERS.SSRN.COM/SOL3/PAPERS.CFM?ABSTRACT_ID=3710251

&GT; FOUR OUT OF EVERY SEVEN COMMON STOCKS THAT HAVE APPEARED IN THE CRSP DATABASE SINCE 1926 HAVE LIFETIME BUY-AND-HOLD RETURNS LESS THAN ONE-MONTH TREASURIES. WHEN STATED IN TERMS OF LIFETIME DOLLAR WEALTH CREATION, THE BEST-PERFORMING **FOUR PERCENT OF LISTED COMPANIES** EXPLAIN THE NET GAIN FOR THE ENTIRE U.S. STOCK MARKET SINCE 1926, AS OTHER STOCKS COLLECTIVELY MATCHED TREASURY BILLS. THESE RESULTS HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF POSITIVE SKEWNESS IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF INDIVIDUAL STOCK RETURNS, ATTRIBUTABLE BOTH TO SKEWNESS IN MONTHLY RETURNS AND TO THE EFFECTS OF COMPOUNDING. THE RESULTS HELP TO EXPLAIN WHY POORLY-DIVERSIFIED ACTIVE STRATEGIES MOST OFTEN UNDERPERFORM MARKET AVERAGES.

MOSTLY IN HOUSING IN AN EXPENSIVE AND HIGH GROWTH HOUSING MARKET, WITH THE GOAL OF MOVING DOWN MARKETS AND GETTING A PAID OFF HOUSE. ALSO ENABLES RENTAL INCOME FROM BASEMENT SUITE. 

AIMING TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD A HOUSE OUTRIGHT WITH SOME AIR B&AMP;B INCOME TO COVER OTHER BILLS BEFORE HAVING KIDS. TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHICH CITY TO MOVE TO. CALGARY, SARNIA, OTTAWA, EAST COAST OR LONDON ARE THE CITIES I'M LOOKING AT. 

NOT REALLY THINKING ABOUT RETIREMENT ATM. IF A BUSINESS TAKES OFF AFTER HAVING A HOUSE PAID OFF, I THINK THAT WILL TAKE CARE OF RETIREMENT. IF NOT, I'LL GET A JOB WORK FOR ANOTHER 35+ YEARS.

CURRENT GIRLFRIEND IS 29 AND ALSO OWN A HOME. NOT SURE HER FINANCIAL SITUATION, BUT I'D GUESS $150K EQUITY.

&GT;THE MAIN POINT IS YOU ALWAYS HEAR ABOUT HOW YOU SHOULD BE DIVERSIFIED (XEQT) BUT IF VFV IS DOING BETTER, ISN'T HIGHER RETURNS THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF INVESTING?

THE GOAL SHOULD BE THE HIGHEST ***RISK-ADJUSTED*** RETURNS.

IF YOUR GOAL IS JUST SEEKING THE HIGHEST RETURN, WHY NOT JUST INVEST EVERYTHING IN ONE STOCK LIKE AAPL? OR TSLA? BOTH OF THOSE STOCKS HAVE COMPLETELY DOMINATED THE S&AMP;P 500. BY YOUR LOGIC, INVESTORS SHOULD PICK 1 STOCK AND HOPE FOR THE BEST? HOW IS THAT DIFFERENT THAN PICKING 1 COUNTRY AND HOPING FOR THE BEST?

&GT;WHAT WOULD YOU PRIORITIZE MORE, DIVERSIFICATION OR TOTAL RETURN?

CONSIDERING THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RETURNS ARE GOING TO BE FOR US VS. GLOBAL STOCKS, THE OPTIMAL WAY OF MAXIMIZING RETURNS IS TO DIVERSIFY. LIKE YOU SAID, THE S&AMP;P 500 BASICALLY MAKES UP ALMOST HALF OF XEQT. SO EVEN IF YOU ONLY HOLD XEQT, NEARLY HALF OF YOUR RETURNS ARE ALREADY GOING TO BE DRIVEN BY A SINGLE MARKET. AS A CANADIAN THERE'S NO GOOD REASON TO ALLOCATE MORE TO THE US MARKET.

WHAT WE DO KNOW, BASED ON CAPE RATIOS, IS THE EXPECTED RETURNS OF US STOCKS ARE LOWER THAN THE EXPECTED RETURNS FOR GLOBAL STOCKS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT DECADE. THE BULL RUN THAT US STOCKS HAD WAS ALMOST STATISTICALLY IMPOSSIBLE.

146,catsaysmrau,CanadianInvestor,"&GT; SHOULD I BE FOCUSING ON ETFS WITH ENTIRELY CANADIAN EXPOSURE?

AVOIDING TAXES IS NOT A A VIABLE INVESTMENT STRATEGY, NOR SHOULD IT BE. HOLDING CANADIAN EQUITY EXPOSURE IS NOT THE SAME AS US EQUITY EXPOSURE.

DO THE ACTUAL MATH ON WHAT 15% OF ANY DIVIDEND PAYMENT ACTUALLY MEANS TO YOU IN DOLLARS AND CENTS. YOU'LL QUICKLY SEE THAT YOU'D SOONER SACRIFICE HOLDING WHAT YOU ACTUALLY WANT OVER SAVING A COUPLE BUCKS.

ALSO IF YOU HOLD A CANADIAN FUND THAT HOLDS US DIVIDEND PAYERS, THE TAX STILL APPLIES SINCE IT IS THE **FUND** THAT IS THE PRIMARY HOLDER OF THOSE SECURITIES. WHOEVER THE END UNIT HOLDER IS DOES NOT MATTER.

THE ONLY WAY TO FULLY AVOID THE TAX IS TO AVOID US SECURITIES ALL TOGETHER (BAD IDEA), OR HOLD ONLY US LISTED STOCKS THAT PAY DIVIDENDS (OR A US LISTED ETF THAT HOLDS US DIVIDEND PAYERS) DIRECTLY IN AN RRSP. BUT THIS MEANS CURRENCY CONVERSION FEES WILL APPLY... SO YOU MAY END UP SPENDING MORE TO AVOID A MINISCULE TAX.


SECOND MOST TAX EFFICIENT ACCOUNT WOULD BE NON-REGISTERED SINCE YOU'D RECEIVE A NON-REFUNDABLE DIVIDEND TAX CREDIT TO OFFSET SOME OF THE TAX... BUT THE DISADVANTAGE HERE IS OBVIOUSLY THAT YOU LOSE OUT ON THE BENEFITS OF A REGISTERED ACCOUNT. 


LEAST EFFICIENT PLACE IS A TFSA... BUT AGAIN, DON'T CUT OFF YOUR NOSE TO SPITE YOUR FACE OVER A PITTANCE. HOLDING US COMPANIES THAT PAY A DIVIDEND IN A TFSA IS **FINE**, ESPECIALLY IF SAID COMPANY IS BEING HELD FOR THE EQUITY GROWTH POTENTIAL AND IT JUST HAPPENS TO PAY A DIVIDEND. AAPL'S FORWARD ANNUAL DIVIDEND IS 0.88/SHARE OR 0.59%. WHAT IS 15% OF THAT? 0.132/SHARE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS WOULD BE WITHHELD. THAT MEANS ON A ~$10,000 INVESTMENT OF 67 SHARES, YOU'D MISS OUT ON $8.844/ YEAR AS TAX. OH NO... BETTER NOT HOLD AAPL IN YOUR TFSA! /S THIS OF COURSE IGNORES ALL THE TAX FREE GROWTH THAT COULD HAVE OTHERWISE OCCURRED. ALSO THE ALTERNATIVE OF HOLDING IT IN AN RRSP INSTEAD MAY BE AN OKAY COMPROMISE, BUT THAT ENTIRELY DEPENDS ON YOU, YOUR FINANCIAL SITUATION, YOU COMFORT LEVEL WITH ACCESS TO FUNDS, AND YOUR GOALS.


OBVIOUSLY I'M JUST USING AAPL AS AN EXAMPLE, HOPEFULLY YOU CAN UNDERSTAND, SYNTHESIZE THIS INFORMATION AND APPLY IT TO YOUR SPECIFIC SITUATION. NO ONE CAN ULTIMATELY MAKE THESE DECISIONS FOR YOU, AND A CHALLENGING ASPECT OF INVESTING IS THAT THERE IS NO CLEAR **RIGHT** ANSWER BECAUSE IT IS ALL SITUATIONALLY DEPENDENT AND FORWARD LOOKING. THERE CAN BE MANY RIGHT ANSWERS IN HINDSIGHT, BUT DOES THAT REALLY MATTER OR HELP YOU IN THE FUTURE? PROBABLY NOT. TO SUM UP, IT'S NOT REALLY WORTH YOUR BRAIN JUICE TO WORRY ABOUT THE 15% WITHHOLDING TAX ON US DIVIDENDS, BE AWARE, MITIGATE IT IF IT MAKES SENSE TO ON A PERSONAL AND $$$ BASIS, BUT IT SHOULD NOT BE THE SOLE DRIVE OF YOUR INVESTMENT DECISIONS.",hcgez9y,t3_pm7xf6,1631380475,1631405675.0,/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/pm7xf6/us_withholding_tax_in_a_tfsa/hcgez9y/

IN FACT, IN MY PREVIOUS POST, A USER NOTED I WAS HIGH IN MY HIGH RISK HOLDINGS, SO I BALANCED DOWN ARKK).   I ALWAYS MAINTAIN AT MINIMUM 10% CASH.

THEREFORE, I BUY STOCK THAT HAVE 90% CHANCE THAT THEY APPRECIATE TO OVER 10% (E.G. MSFT, HD, SHOP, AAPL ETC). I HAVE SET UP WATCHLIST AND ALERTS TO ENSURE I TIME BUYING OPPORTUNITY.

QT WAS OUTSTANDING AS I WANTED IT IN MY RRSP BUT DUE TO NB LAW IT HAS TO GO INTO A LIRA AND THEY SAVED ME A TON ON THAT MISTAKE.  I HAD ONE ADVISOR AT QT HE CALLED ME, EMAILED ME CONSTANT UPDATES AND WHEN THE LIRA ISSUE POPPED UP HE WAS AMAZING AT EXPLAINING IT, NO CALL CENTER, ONE GUY START TO FINISH!  SO NOW I HAVE A RRSP AND LIRA WITH QT.

209,Shoopshopship,CanadianInvestor,"CANADIAN IMPERIAL BANK OF COMMERCE CM-T +0.42%INCREASE
IS LAUNCHING CANADA‚ÄôS FIRST DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS LINKED TO U.S. STOCKS, CREATING A NEW WAY FOR RETAIL INVESTORS TO TRADE IN LARGE AMERICAN COMPANIES WITHOUT THE FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK INHERENT IN BUYING THOSE SHARES DIRECTLY.

CIBC‚ÄôS FIRST BATCH OF CANADIAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS (CDRS) WILL BE TIED TO AMAZON.COM INC.‚ÄôS AMZN-Q +0.51%INCREASE
STOCK AND IS EXPECTED TO START TRADING ON TUESDAY ON THE NEO EXCHANGE. THE CDRS ARE MODELLED AFTER U.S. DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS (ADRS), A TRILLION-DOLLAR MARKET THAT HAS EXISTED FOR DECADES SOUTH OF THE BORDER AS AN ALTERNATIVE WAY TO ACCESS FOREIGN COMPANIES‚Äô STOCKS, BUT WHICH HAD NO DIRECT EQUIVALENT IN CANADA.

DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS ARE A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT ISSUED BY BANKS THAT REPRESENT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF SHARES IN A COMPANY THAT IS LISTED AND TRADED ABROAD, ALLOWING DOMESTIC INVESTORS TO HAVE EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN STOCKS WITHOUT BUYING THEM DIRECTLY ON A FOREIGN STOCK EXCHANGE. WITH THE POPULARITY OF DO-IT-YOURSELF INVESTING SURGING IN THE PANDEMIC AND BROAD-BASED INTEREST IN PROMINENT U.S. STOCKS, ESPECIALLY IN THE TECHNOLOGY SECTOR, CDRS CAN GIVE CANADIAN INVESTORS A LOW-COST WAY TO TRADE IN U.S. STOCKS THAT SIDESTEPS POTENTIAL DRAWBACKS FROM FLUCTUATING CURRENCIES.

THE KEY FEATURE OF THE NEW CDRS IS THAT THEY HAVE A BUILT-IN HEDGE AGAINST CHANGING FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, ELIMINATING THE RISK THAT A CANADIAN INVESTOR‚ÄôS RETURN ON A U.S. STOCK WILL BE EATEN AWAY BY MOVES IN THE RELATIVE VALUE OF THE TWO COUNTRIES‚Äô DOLLARS.

MANY CANADIAN INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS ARE LOADED WITH DOMESTIC EQUITIES, AND CDRS OFFER AN OPTION TO DIVERSIFY THOSE HOLDINGS, BUT TO ‚ÄúOWN THE COMPANY, NOT THE CURRENCY,‚Äù ELLIOT SCHERER, MANAGING DIRECTOR IN THE WEALTH SOLUTIONS GROUP AT CIBC WORLD MARKETS INC., SAID IN AN INTERVIEW.

AS ONE RECENT EXAMPLE, THE CANADIAN DOLLAR STRENGTHENED BY MORE THAN 10 PER CENT RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR BETWEEN JULY, 2020, AND MAY THIS YEAR, WEAKENING THE RETURNS SOME INVESTORS EARNED ON U.S. STOCKS.

‚ÄúIF YOU‚ÄôRE A CANADIAN AND YOU‚ÄôRE INVESTING IN U.S. SHARES DURING THAT PERIOD, YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN PRETTY DISAPPOINTED. YOU‚ÄôD SEE THE S&AMP;P 500 HITTING NEW HIGHS ALL THE TIME, AND YET YOU‚ÄôRE NOT SEEING THAT FULL GAIN IN THE CANADIAN-DOLLAR RETURN IN YOUR PORTFOLIO,‚Äù MR. SCHERER SAID. ‚ÄúINVESTMENT ADVISERS WOULD OFTEN VENT ABOUT THIS ISSUE TO MY TEAM.‚Äù

IT TOOK CIBC THREE YEARS TO DEVELOP AND LAUNCH CDRS, WITH A TEAM THAT INCLUDED TRADERS, ENGINEERS AND A LAWYER. THE BANK ALSO HAD TO GET APPROVAL FROM THE ONTARIO SECURITIES COMMISSION. AND IT CHOSE THE RELATIVELY YOUNG NEO EXCHANGE AS ITS LISTING PARTNER FOR ITS EXPERIENCE IN THE EXCHANGE-TRADED FUND MARKET AND ITS REPUTATION AS FAST-MOVING AND OPEN TO NEW IDEAS, MR. SCHERER SAID.

THE CDRS ALSO TAP INTO ANOTHER GROWING TREND: TRADING IN FRACTIONAL SHARES, WHICH MAKES COMPANIES WITH HIGH SHARE PRICES MORE ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYDAY INVESTORS. THE CDRS WILL INITIALLY BE PRICED AT $20 EACH, WHICH WOULD ALLOW A CUSTOMER TO EFFECTIVELY OWN A SMALL SLICE OF A SHARE IN AMAZON.COM, WHICH COST US$3,656.64 AS OF THE MARKET CLOSE ON FRIDAY.

BEFORE LONG, CIBC PLANS TO INTRODUCE CDRS TIED TO ALPHABET INC. GOOG-Q +3.37%INCREASE
, THE PARENT COMPANY OF GOOGLE, AS WELL AS APPLE INC. AAPL-Q +1.20%INCREASE
, NETFLIX INC. NFLX-Q +0.71%INCREASE
AND TESLA INC. TSLA-Q -0.91%DECREASE
. OVER THE COMING MONTHS, THE BANK IS SET TO EXPAND ITS CDR LISTINGS TO INCLUDE OTHER PROMINENT S&AMP;P 500 COMPANIES.

‚ÄúIT‚ÄôS THE RIGHT MOMENT,‚Äù JOS SCHMITT, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF NEO GROUP, SAID IN AN INTERVIEW. ‚ÄúCIBC FOUND A GREAT GAP AND OPPORTUNITY IN THE MARKET.‚Äù

THE CDRS TRADE IN CANADIAN DOLLARS, AND CIBC ADJUSTS THE RATIO OF DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS TO COMPANY SHARES DAILY TO ACCOUNT FOR CHANGES IN CURRENCY VALUES. THE BANK CHARGES NO MANAGEMENT FEES FOR CDRS, BUT EARNS SMALL FEES FROM THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS IT MAKES IN THE BACKGROUND TO MANAGE THE CURRENCY HEDGE FOR INVESTORS. THE MAXIMUM SPREAD BETWEEN RATES THAT CIBC CAN COLLECT FROM THOSE TRANSACTIONS IS CAPPED AT 60 BASIS POINTS ON AN ANNUALIZED BASIS. CIBC MELLON WILL ACT AS THE CUSTODIAN BANK.

MR. SCHERER AND MR. SCHMITT EXPECT EARLY INTEREST IN CDRS TO COME MOSTLY FROM DO-IT-YOURSELF INVESTORS AND INVESTMENT ADVISERS. BUT THEY ALSO ANTICIPATE THERE COULD BE DEMAND FROM HIGH NET WORTH INVESTORS, SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AND FAMILY OFFICES.

IF CIBC‚ÄôS CDRS ARE POPULAR, THE BANK ANTICIPATES THAT COMPETITORS WILL RESPOND. NOW THAT CIBC HAS LAID THE REGULATORY GROUNDWORK, OTHER BANKS COULD OFFER THEIR OWN CDRS. AND ONLINE RIVAL WEALTHSIMPLE RECENTLY STARTED ALLOWING CLIENTS OF ITS TRADING PRODUCT TO BUY FRACTIONAL SHARES IN CERTAIN CANADIAN AND U.S. COMPANIES, INCLUDING THE SAME FIVE STOCKS INCLUDED IN CIBC‚ÄôS LAUNCH OF CDRS.

‚ÄúI THINK YOU HAVE TO BE REALISTIC. WHEN SOMEONE COMES WITH A GOOD AND UNIQUE IDEA, COMPETITION IS GOING TO FOLLOW,‚Äù MR. SCHMITT SAID.",h6kmjj4,t3_orw4vd,1627296047,1627321247.0,/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/orw4vd/cibc_launching_trading_of_american_companies_on/h6kmjj4/

I'M MAINLY LOOKING FOR FEEDBACK AS TO HOW MUCH I SHOULD INVEST IN MY MARGIN ACCOUNT SINCE MY REGISTERED ACCOUNTS ARE FULL. I STARTED BUYING INTO THE HYPE FOR CRYPTO/MEME STOCKS LATELY BUT I MAKE SURE NOT TO PUT MORE THAN 5% INTO THIS CATEGORY. MY STRATEGY FOR MY MARGIN ACCOUNT IS TO BUY VT &AMP; AVUV MAINLY, SELL OFF TSLA/MEMES SOON WHEN THE EVER CLIMBS. I'D SAY I'M MOSTLY A PASSIVE CONSERVATIVE INVESTOR FOR MY TFSA/RRSP. 

I'VE DECREASED MY EMERGENCY ACCOUNT FROM 5K TO 1.5K (EARNING 1.15% IN A HISA) SINCE MY MONTHLY EXPENSES ARE LOW, AND IF THERE WERE A VERY SERIOUS EMERGENCY, I'D PROBABLY TAKE MONEY OUT FROM MY MARGIN ACCOUNT.  I'D SAY 80% OF MY INCOME IS GOING INTO SAVINGS/INVESTING.

I DON'T HAVE MANY GOALS AT THE MOMENT. I HAVE STUDENT DEBT OF 17K, BUT THE INTEREST RATE IS 2.95%, AND WILL BE APPLIED IN MARCH 2022

MONTHLY EXPENSES: $50 - $100/MONTH  
SHOPPING/DISCRETIONARY SPENDING: $0 - $500/MONTH 

EMERGENCY ACCOUNT: $1,500 (HISA 1.15% INTEREST), WILL PLAN TO INCREASE IT TO 5K BY SEPTEMBER

DEBT: STUDENT LOANS 17K AT 2.95% STARTING IN MARCH 2022

271,digital_tuna,CanadianInvestor,"BECAUSE YOU CAN'T JUST COMPARE RETURNS WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE RISK. RISKING IT ALL ON 1 COUNTRY ISN'T MUCH DIFFERENT THAN RISKING IT ALL ON 1 STOCK.

AAPL IS IN THE S&AMP;P 500 AND IT HAS VASTLY OUTPERFORMED VFV OVER THE LAST 5 YEARS SO WHY NOT JUST INVEST EVERYTHING IN AAPL? YOU SHOULDN'T, BECAUSE THAT'S TAKING A LOT OF RISK AND THERE'S NO GUARANTEE AAPL WILL CONTINUE TO OUTPERFORM THE S&AMP;P 500. THE SMARTER MOVE WOULD BE TO INVEST IN THE ENTIRE S&AMP;P 500 SO YOU'RE REDUCING THE RISK OF A SINGLE COMPANY HURTING YOUR PORTFOLIO. SO IT'S THE SAME COMPARISON WITH VFV TO VEQT.....INVESTING IN VFV IS ONLY INVESTING IN 1 COUNTRY, WHEREAS VEQT IS INVESTING IN EVERY COUNTRY. SO RATHER THAN RISKING 1 COUNTRY HURTING YOUR PORTFOLIO, DIVERSIFY YOUR MONEY AMONG ALL OF THEM.

LOOK AT [THIS SITE OF GLOBAL STOCK MARKET](HTTPS://COUNTRYECONOMY.COM/STOCK-EXCHANGE) RETURNS, CLICK ON THE YTD COLUMN TO SORT BY RETURNS. LOOK AT ALL THE OTHER GLOBAL MARKETS THAT HAVE BETTER RETURNS THAN THE S&AMP;P 500 SO FAR THIS YEAR. YES SOME OF THOSE COUNTRIES ARE PERFORMING WORSE THAN THE US AND SOME ARE PERFORMING BETTER, BUT THERE'S NO WAY TO KNOW IN ADVANCE WHICH COUNTRY IS GOING TO DO THE BEST EACH YEAR....WHICH IS WHY IT'S A SAFER BET TO OWN ALL OF THEM. JUST LIKE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO KNOW WHICH COMPANY IN THE S&AMP;P 500 IS GOING TO PERFORM THE BEST, SO IT'S SAFER TO JUST OWN THEM ALL.

**TL;DR JUST BECAUSE THE S&AMP;P 500 OUTPERFORMED THE GLOBAL MARKETS FOR THE LAST 5 YEARS DOESN'T MEAN IT WILL CONTINUE TO OUTPERFORM. FOR ALL WE KNOW, THE S&AMP;P 500 WILL LAG BEHIND THE GLOBAL MARKETS FOR THE NEXT 20 YEARS. FOR THAT REASON, YOU'RE BETTER OFF OWNING A LITTLE SLICE OF EVERY COUNTRY TO MITIGATE THE RISK.

282,kidvibe,CanadianInvestor,"AAPL IS A FUNNY ONE - I THINK BECAUSE IT SHOT UP HIGHER THAN THE OTHER FAANG COMPANIES OVER THE LAST YEAR IS THE REASON WHY GROWTH IN 2021 HAS BEEN HALTED.

2 INSANE QUARTERS THUS FAR. MORE TO COME. I'M BULLISH AND WILL HOLD FOR A LONG TIME. 

REGARDING U/BLITZDOG416'S COMMENT, APPLE'S MOAT IS GROWING AND WILL CONTINUE TO GROW. IT'S THE STICKIEST BRAND OUT THERE.

FROM WHAT I'VE READ, APPLE IS TRANSITIONING FROM HARDWARE TO SOFTWARE. THEY CARE LESS ABOUT THEIR PHONES AND MORE ABOUT THEIR SERVICES (I THINK THEY HAVE 600 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS NOW). 

THEY'RE GETTING INTO HEALTHCARE, ALREADY HAVE THEIR OWN PAYMENT SYSTEM, STREAMING SERVICE, ETC. 

IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S NEXT - IT'S THEIR [M1 CHIPS](HTTPS://YOUTU.BE/F4G2NPY-VZC) \- WHICH ARE THE BEST AVAILABLE. THESE THINGS ARE INSANE.  

BUT, WHAT'S THE NEXT BIG THING? THAT'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE AR/VR - THIS CAN BE AS REVOLUTIONARY AS THE SMARTPHONE/IPHONE. THIS IS WHY APPLE IS SLOWLY PUSHING FACEBOOK, GOOGLE AWAY FROM THEIR IOS ECOSYSTEM (TRACKING, ETC). STAY TUNED.

285,MRobi83,CanadianInvestor,"YOU'RE SPEAKING AS IF A DRIP ALWAYS BUYS ADDITIONAL SHARES WHEN THE PRICE IS LOW. THAT'S SIMPLY NOT HOW IT WORKS.

YES IF YOU HAVE $100 TO INVEST AND YOU INVEST IT WHEN THE SHARE PRICE IS $10 VS $15 YOU WILL GET MORE SHARES. BUT IF YOU RECEIVE THAT $100 IN A DRIP WHEN THE PRICE IS $15, THE MONEY ISN'T GOING TO SIT THERE AND WAIT FOR IT TO GET BACK TO $10 TO BE RE-INVESTED. THE FACT IS, YOU HAVE ZERO CONTROL ON WHEN THAT DRIP GETS RE-INVESTED. IT COULD GET IN ON A MOMENTARY DIP AND THE STOCK IS TRADING AT $8, OR IT COULD GET IN ON A MOMENTARY RISE WHEN THE STOCK IS TRADING AT $18. IT'S AUTOMATIC SO YOU CAN'T CONTROL IT.

HERE'S A VERY SIMPLE AND FICTIONAL EXAMPLE FOR YOU.... LET'S SAY YOU HOLD BOTH AAPL AND TSLA. ARGUABLY BOTH GOOD STOCKS TO OWN AND LIKELY TO HOLD. YOU'RE NOT LOOKING TO SELL EITHER. AAPL PAYS A SMALL DIVIDEND, TSLA PAYS NONE. WHEN THE DIVIDEND FROM AAPL PAYS OUT, TSLA HAPPENS TO BE AT IT'S LOWEST POINT OF THE YEAR IN AND AROUND $560, MEANWHILE AAPL IS TRADING NEAR IT'S ATH OF $145. IF YOU THINK BOTH ARE GOOD COMPANIES TO HOLD LONG TERM, WOULDN'T YOU THINK IT MAKES MOST SENSE TO PUT YOUR AVAILABLE MONEY INTO STRENGTHENING YOUR POSITION IN TSLA WHILE IT'S LOW INSTEAD OF BUYING MORE AAPL WHILE IT'S AT IT'S RECORD HIGH? NOW THE REVERSE COULD ALSO BE TRUE. AAPL COULD PAY OUT IT'S DIVIDEND WHILE IT'S TRADING AROUND $110 AND TSLA IS APPROACHING $900. IN THIS CASE, IT WOULD MAKE MOST SENSE TO PUT THAT MONEY INTO MORE AAPL.  

THIS EXAMPLE IS NOT SOME IRRELEVANT EDGE CASE. THIS EXAMPLE HAPPENS EVERY SINGLE DAY WHERE THERE ARE PRIME BUYING OPPORTUNITIES. I WOULD PERSONALLY RATHER POSITION MYSELF TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES RATHER THAN BEING FORCED TO FURTHER BUY INTO A COMPANY. 

IF YOU CONTRIBUTE $1,000 ON THE 1ST DAY OF EVERY MONTH AND YOU DIRECT THAT $1,000 INTO THE FUNDS OF YOUR CHOICE, WHY SHOULD IT MATTER IF THAT $1,000 CAME FROM YOUR CHEQUING ACCOUNT OR FROM A DIVIDEND PAYMENT? NOW IF YOU CONTRIBUTE $1,000 EVERY MONTH AS PART OF A PAC AND CHECK YOUR ACCOUNT EVERY 2-3 YEARS...

291,catsaysmrau,CanadianInvestor,"&GT; OVER TIME, THE SHARE PRICE GOES UP, BUT ALSO THE CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE.

IF YOU'RE A ROBOT/ALGORITHM TRADING MILLIONS OF TIMES PER SECOND, CURRENCY ARBITRAGE IS GREAT! BUT FOR US MERE MORTALS (OR RATHER THOSE OF US THAT ARE NOT CREATING AND RUNNING HFT ALGOS ON SUPERCOMPUTERS WHERE EVEN PHYSICAL CABLE LENGTHS MATTER... READ FLASH BOYS BY MICHAEL LEWIS), ANY CURRENCY ARBITRAGE OPPORTUNITY IS IMPERCEPTIBLE/NON-EXISTENT IN PRACTICAL TERMS BECAUSE ON SUFFICIENTLY LIQUID SECURITIES, ANY FLUCTUATIONS IN THE CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE IS BASICALLY CORRECTED IN REAL TIME THROUGH REGULAR TRADING.

NOT SAYING THERE COULDN'T POSSIBLY BE A BENEFIT. IF YOU HAVE A REASON TO HOLD ONE CURRENCY OVER ANOTHER, SURE. SAY YOU WANT TO SELL AN INTER-LISTED CAD HOLDING LIKE CNR IN USD BECAUSE YOU'RE USING PROCEEDS TO PURCHASE A DIFFERENT NON-INTER-LISTED USD SECURITY LIKE AAPL... AND DON'T MIND WAITING FOR IT TO PROCESS ALL THE WHILE RUNNING THE ADDITIONAL RISK OF OPPORTUNITY COST. WHAT IF AAPL INCREASE BY X% WHILE YOU'RE WAITING FOR THE JOURNALING TO PROCESS, AND NOW YOUR ADDITIONAL COST IS GREATER THAN WHAT THE CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE WOULD BE? MINIMIZING FEES, WHILE IMPORTANT TO BE AWARE OF, SHOULD NOT BE THE ONLY CONSIDERATION IN ANY INVESTMENT STRATEGY. SOMETIMES YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR AND WHILE AVOIDING FEES END UP CUTTING OFF YOUR NOSE TO SPITE YOUR FACE.

AS FOR WHAT TO DO NOW THAT CAD HAS INCREASED IN VALUE RELATIVE TO USD, WELL NO ONE KNOWS. IT'S ALL RELATIVE. COULD WORK IN YOUR FAVOUR OR NOT. IF YOU BUY A USD SECURITY NOW AND IT GOES UP 2%, BUT THE VALUE OF CAD ALSO INCREASES BY 2% RELATIVE TO USD, ALL THINGS CONSIDERED VALUE-WISE YOU'RE BREAK EVEN AND THE EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATION WIPED OUT YOUR GAIN. ONLY WAY AROUND THIS IS HEDGING, WHICH (YOU GUESSED IT!) ISN'T FREE AND HAS ASSOCIATED FEES. NO FREE LUNCH MY FRIEND. TAKING ADVANTAGE OF OUR STRONG EXCHANGE RATE NOW TO PURCHASE INVESTMENTS (OR ANY FOREIGN INVESTMENT) IS BASICALLY AN ADDITIONAL LAYER OF SPECULATION. MEANING YOU ARE SPECULATING THAT A) YOUR INVESTMENT WILL INCREASE IN VALUE, B) THE CURRENCY THAT YOU HOLD THE INVESTMENT IN WILL EITHER WORK OUT IN YOUR FAVOUR OR AT LEAST STAY STABLE RELATIVE TO YOUR HOME CURRENCY, AND C) THAT CURRENCY RISK IS WORTHWHILE TO GAIN EXPOSURE TO THAT SPECIFIC INVESTMENT.",gzog5fi,t3_nmc3fy,1622147019,1622172219.0,/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/nmc3fy/cn_rail_buying_in_americancni_vs_canadiancnr/gzog5fi/

I AM PLANNING ON ADDING MY $25,000 IN MUTUAL FUNDS (FIDELITY GLOBAL BALANCED PORTFOLIO SER. B, CODE 2204, 40%/60% BONDS/EQUITY, 7% 10YR ANNUALIZED RETURN) INTO MY WEALTH SIMPLE ACCOUNT, AT WHICH POINT THE PORTFOLIO WOULD BE IN THE $35,000-50,000 RANGE A YEAR FROM NOW.  

I AM INTENDING TO INCREASE MY POSITIONS IN BOTH INDEX ETFS AND BOND ETFS AS A PROPORTION OF MY PORTFOLIO, SO BEING ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THE INTENDED ALLOCATIONS (WHILE ALSO BUYING SOME SINGLE STOCKS ALONG THE WAY) AS I'M ADDING MORE FUNDS IS HELPFUL.  IT ALSO SERVES AS MOTIVATION TO SAVE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE, RATHER THAN BUY SOME NEAT TOYS (OCULUS QUEST 2 AND THE M1 POWERED IPAD PRO BOTH LOOK LIKE THEY COULD BE FUN TO PLAY WITH, BUT I COULD BUY SOME FB AND AAPL INSTEAD...).",gxj1a8b,t3_n8i1me,1620588604,1620613804.0,/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/n8i1me/my_wealthsimple_portfolio_trackerplanner_google/gxj1a8b/

DIVERSIFICATION IS THE ONLY FREE LUNCH, IF YOU INSIST ON XQQ (WHICH IS WORSE THAN ZNQ AND RECENCY BIAS, BUT WE‚ÄôLL IGNORE THAT), WHY NOT VUN AND XQQ SO THAT AT LEAST YOU‚ÄôRE DIVERSIFIED ACROSS SMALL AND MID CAPS AND LESS CONCENTRATED IN THE XQQ OVERLAP?

OF COURSE MY ADVICE IS VUN ALONE, BUT EVEN IF I BOUGHT YOUR ARGUMENT XQQ IS WORTH HAVING, XQQ AND VFV IS JUST BUYING THE SAME ETF TWICE:

VFV VS XQQ: 

- AAPL 5.6 + 11.0

- MSFT 5.2 + 9.1

- AMZN 3.9 + 8.6

HOWEVER, I KIND OF STOPPED PAYING ATTENTION TO THE MARKET IN EARLY 2020 (YES I KNOW, A BAD MISTAKE) AND LVS STOPPED IT'S DIVIDEND. SO I WILL PROBABLY TRIM PROFITS.

MY COST/SHARE ON AAPL IS $16.50, SO I MAY TRIM PROFITS. BUT AT CURRENT PRICE I SEE IT BELOW IT'S POTENTIAL. HOWEVER, I AGREE WITH YOU AND I WILL NOT BE INVESTING NEW MONEY. IF IT DROPS AROUND $80 (LIKE IT DID DURING 2020), THEN I THINK IT IS A GREAT INVESTMENT.

*FOR EXAMPLE, ASSUME THAT APPLE INC. (AAPL) IS TRADING AT $170.00 AND AN INVESTOR WANTS TO BUY THE STOCK ONCE IT BEGINS TO SHOW SOME SERIOUS UPWARD MOMENTUM. THE INVESTOR HAS PUT IN A STOP-LIMIT ORDER TO BUY WITH THE STOP PRICE AT $180.00 AND THE LIMIT PRICE AT $185.00. IF THE PRICE OF AAPL MOVES ABOVE THE $180.00 STOP PRICE, THE ORDER IS ACTIVATED AND TURNS INTO A LIMIT ORDER. AS LONG AS THE ORDER CAN BE FILLED UNDER $185.00, WHICH IS THE LIMIT PRICE, THE TRADE WILL BE FILLED. IF THE STOCK GAPS ABOVE $185.00, THE ORDER WILL NOT BE FILLED.*
