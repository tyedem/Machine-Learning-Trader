40,DonArcher007,CanadianInvestor,"NO, ,   THERE WONâ€™T BE ANY FUTURE FX BECAUSE YOUR STOCK WILL BE IN YOUR USD SIDE OF YOUR TFSA.

SO YOU SWITCH CDN OVER TO US SIDE .....THAT IS A FX COST.

THEN YOU BUY GOOG IN USD ....HOLD IT FOR A WHILE , SELL IT &AMP; GET US DOLLARS, THEN BUY AMZN WITH THE US DOLLARS, THEN SELL IT AFTER A WHILE &AMP; GET USD ., ETC ETC ETC.      ALL OF THOSE TRANSACTIONS ARE TAKING  PLACE IN USD  AND THERE IS NEVER FX CONVERSION INVOLVED
