DON'T BUY ANYTHING WITH A NICE YIELD ON IT. WE DON'T HAVE A TAX TREATY WITH AMERICA FOR TFSAS THE SAME WAY WE DO RRSPS. UNCLE SAM IS GONNA CHARGE HIS WITHHOLDING TAXES IN FULL AND IT NEGATES THE VIABILITY OF BUYING US DIVIDEND STOCKS IN IT. 

BUY SOMETHING LIKE GOOG OR TSLA AND YOU'RE LAUGHING. 

ALSO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE A USD TFSA ACCOUNT WITH YOUR BROKER. YOU CAN BUY AN INTERESTED SECURITY IN CAD ON TSE, JOURNAL IT TO THE USD ACCOUNT, SELL IT, AND HAVE USD WHILE ONLY PAYING THE TRADING FEES (HOPEFULLY YOU GET SOME FREE TRADES IF IT'S A NEW ACCOUNT).
