307,vasilenko93,wallstreetbets,"I DON‚ÄôT UNDERSTAND TESLA INVESTORS DESIRE TO BRING TESLA INTO THE SAME CIRCLE AS APPLE OR FACEBOOK. THE GROWTH AND PROFITS ARE NOT THE SAME.

FACEBOOK IS PURELY SOFTWARE. THEY WRITE IT ONCE AND IT CAN IN THEORY GET THE ENTIRE POPULATION OF THE WORLD USING IT (CLOSE TO IT NOW) WITH LITTLE ADDITIONAL COSTS. A NEW CUSTOMER IS PRETTY MUCH ZERO EXPENSE.

FOR APPLE IT‚ÄôS A LITTLE DIFFERENT. A NEW IPHONE CUSTOMER IS A LITTLE MORE EXPENSE AS IT‚ÄôS A PHYSICAL PRODUCT. THE COSTS ARE OFFSET BY THE PREMIUM PRICE TAG AND MASSIVE USE OF THEIR SOFTWARE SERVICES LIKE APPSTORE IN WHICH A NEW CUSTOMER IS BASICALLY NO COSTS, JUST PROFIT.

IN BOTH CASES, AND FOR MOST TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES, THEIR PROFITS ARE NOT LINEAR BUT EXPONENTIAL AS GROWTH HAPPENS, EACH NEW CUSTOMER IS NOT NEW COSTS.A STORE HAS LINEAR PROFITS AS GROWTH HAPPENS BECAUSE EACH NEW CUSTOMER IS MORE COSTS.

TESLA IS NOT A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY BECAUSE FOR EVERY CAR SALE THEY HAVE FIXED COSTS. MANUFACTURING.

SUPERCHARGER NETWORK THE SAME THING, A CAR PAYING TO CHARGE IS TAKING A SLOT AND USING ELECTRICITY. LINEAR PROFIT GROWTH, NOT EXPONENTIAL. 

TESLA INSURANCE? MORE CARS INSURED SPREADS COSTS BUT ALSO INCREASES LIABILITIES, INSURANCE IS NOT A MASSIVELY PROFITABLE INDUSTRY AS SEEN BY ITS PE RATIOS.

HERE IS THE CLOSEST WAY TESLA CAN BECOME A TECHNOLOGY COMPANY TO REACH SIMILAR SUSTAINABLE PE RATIOS: ROBO TAXI.

480,glhfglhf,wallstreetbets,"BULLSHIT.

I HAVE NO CURRENT POSITION, I SHORTED AND LONGED TESLA IN THE PAST, BUT TESLA SHOULD BE AROUND THE HEIGHT OF THEIR VALUATION RIGHT NOW:

RIGHT NOW, THEY OWN THE EV MARKET. IF YOU ARE IN THE MARKET FOR A NEW CAR THE CHOICE IS A TESLA OR $BRAND COMBUSTION ENGINE. 

WE ARE AT THE POINT WHERE EV'S START TO MAKE MONEY AND THIS IS WHERE ALL THE OTHER BRANDS START TO CREATE CARS FOR IT. THEY HAVE MANY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN CREATING DEMAND, OPERATING A NETWORK FOR REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE, AND OPERATING IN ECONOMICALLY BAD TIMES. 

IN ~5 YEARS TIME, WHEN MOST CONSUMERS WILL CHANGE TO EV, TESLA WILL BE OLD AND BORING, YOU SEE THEM 100 TIMES PER DAY IN CALIFORNIA AND WESTERN EUROPE. THERE WILL BE &GT;100 COMPETITORS ON THE EV MARKET, SINCE ITS CHEAPER TO ACCESS THAN THE COMBUSTION MARKET, AND THEY WILL ALL BE PUMPING MONEY INTO MARKETING TO GET A PIECE OF THIS MARKET. 

WE AS HUMANS WANT EV'S TO WORK, THIS IS WHY WE LIKE ELON, AND WANT TESLA TO WORK, BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE TO CHANGE OUR BEHAVIOR TO FEEL GREEN. BUT THE MOMENT WE HAVE REAL ALTERNATIVES, WE WILL DIVERSIFY IN OUR CONSUMER BEHAVIOR, ITS HUMAN NATURE. TESLAS WILL BECOME LESS ""COOL"" AND MORE MAINSTREAM EVERY YEAR. 

TESLA HAS THE SUPERCHARGE NETWORK GOING FOR IT, AND I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF THEY STOP MAKING CARS AT ALL WITHIN 10 YEARS (NO MARGIN ANYMORE IN 2030 DUE TO COMPETITION) AND FOCUS ON DEVELOPING AND LICENSING TECH FOR THE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE.
