5,_ChamClowder_,CanadianInvestor,"-THE MARKET CAN BE VERY IRRATIONAL AND IT‚ÄôS IMPORTANT TO EVALUATE THE IRRATIONALITY FROM AFAR. SOMETIMES IT PRESENTS OPPORTUNITIES, AND SOMETIMES IT SKEWS YOUR VISION. OVERALL, IT CAN BE A DETRIMENT TO YOUR FUTURE EXPECTATIONS.

-FAVOURITE: GME. THERE WAS A LOT OF MONEY TO BE HAD JUST WRITING OPTIONS ON IT. OVERALL, SHEER LUCK ON THIS ONE, BUT IT WAS A CRAZY CRAZY TIME LOOKING BACK.

-KNOWLEDGE 1: MANY NEW INVESTORS HERE. IF YOU ARE BEGINNING IN THE MARKET, DO NOT INVEST IN ANYTHING OTHER THAN BROAD MARKET ETFS UNTIL YOU HAVE $20K+ TO INVEST.

-KNOWLEDGE 2: WHEN YOU DO PICK A STOCK, BEGIN BY ALLOCATING ONLY A SMALL AMOUNT OF YOUR PORTFOLIO, SAY 10% INTO IT. MOST IMPORTANTLY, PICK A STOCK YOU TRULY HAVE PASSION FOR AND A SECTOR YOU HAVE INTEREST IN. THIS FORCES YOU TO FOLLOW IT AND THE NEWS SURROUNDING IT.

FROM MY OBSERVATION THE MARKET PRICES TSLA ALWAYS A FEW ‚ÄúMILESTONES‚Äù AHEAD - AS IF EVENTS HAVE ALREADY HAPPENED. FOR EXAMPLE, BERLIN AND AUSTIN FACTORIES ARE PRICED IN EVEN THOUGH NO CARS HAVE BEEN MADE YET. (SO FOR A ‚ÄúNORMAL STOCK‚Äù IT IS LIKE IT PRICED SOME YEARS AHEAD OF ACTUAL EXECUTION). YOU COULD SAY THIS STATEMENT MEANS IT IS OVERVALUED, BUT THIS IS SEMANTICS. WHETHER SOMETHING IS OVER OR UNDER VALUED IS UP TO ‚ÄúIN WHAT CONTEXT‚Äù.

CASE IN POINT  - ONE CAN THINK THE STOCK AT CURRENT PRICES TO STILL BE ‚ÄúWELL BELOW‚Äù WHAT CAN BE REASONABLY INFERRED FROM A RISK/BENEFIT POTENTIAL UPSIDE ANALYSIS AND GET TO SOME ‚ÄúVERY CRAZY‚Äù VALUATIONS QUITE QUICKLY AND WITH ‚ÄúREASONABLE‚Äù METHODS. (NUMBERS AND MODELS THROWN AROUND THAT I‚ÄôVE SEEN USED CAN END UP WITH NUMBERS LIKE 10T, +20T AS VALUATIONS). 

WHEN YOU LOOK AT IT AS A BUSINESS, AND WHAT THE BUSINESS WORLD WILL LOOK LIKE DECADES INTO THE FUTURE, IF YOU CAN SEE THE FUTURE CLEARLY IN A PARTICULAR COMPANY AND INDUSTRY - YOU CAN BE MORE CONFIDENT IN A FURTHER OUT VALUATION.  SO, IF ONE HAS A HIGH DEGREE OF CONFIDENCE THAT WITH TRADITIONAL VALUATIONS AND BENCHMARK PRICING  THAT SOMETHING IS LIKELY TO GET TO A POINT IN TIME (LIKE WHEN A BUSINESS HAS MATURED AND STOPPED ACCELERATING IN THEIR GROWTH DUE TO MARKET SATURATION) IF A PERSON CAN BE CONFIDENT IN A 10-20X GAIN FAR ENOUGH INTO THE FUTURE, IS THAT STOCK STILL OVERVALUED?

TESLA IS A COMPANY THAT HAS ALWAYS HAD MUCH MORE OF ITS FUTURE PRICED IN THAN WHAT IS COMMON. THIS MEANS FOR MOST IT WILL BE PERENNIALLY OVER VALUED.

TO EXPLAIN THE CURRENT VALUATION MANY ‚ÄúBULLS‚Äù VIEW THIS AS:
- THEY ARE THE FIRST COMPANY TO SCALE EV PRODUCTION AND BE CASH FLOW POSITIVE ON THAT SYSTEM. THIS MEANS THEY ARE PAST THE INFAMOUS ‚ÄúVALLEY OF DEATH‚Äù AND ARE ESSENTIALLY AS OF RIGHT NOW THE LEAST LIKELY TO GO OUT OF BUSINESS AS AN AUTO COMPANY LOOKING AHEAD 20 YEARS.
- THEY HAVE BEEN AT THIS FOR 10+ YEARS MORE THAN THE COMPETITION, AND THEIR TECH, PLATFORM AND EXPERTISE IS 5ISH+ YEARS AHEAD OF THE REST. DON‚ÄôT LISTEN TO THE PUNDITS, READ THE FUCKING FILINGS AND SEE YOURSELF. 
- IT IS, IN MANY WAYS MOST COMPARABLE COMPANY WISE TO APPLE (EVEN THOUGH IT STILL ISN‚ÄôT A GREAT COMPARISON). GROSS MARGINS ARE LIKELY TO BE MAINTAINED, IMPROVED AND TO BE IN THE BALL PARK OF APPLE. TESLA‚ÄôS OPPORTUNITY VS APPLE IS PROPORTIONAL TO ‚ÄúTRANSPORT SPENDING‚Äù (TESLA) TO ‚ÄúCONSUMER ELECTRONICS SPENDING‚Äù (APPLE). GENERALLY, SPEND ON TRANSPORT (LTV) IS ABOUT 10X THAT OF PERSONAL ELECTRONICS. 
- TESLA IN A HISTORIC SENSE IS A WEIRD MIX BETWEEN FORD WHEN THEY STARTED AND GE, AND CAN BE THOUGHT OF AS THE FIRST BREAK OUT IN THIS ‚ÄúNEXT‚Äù INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION.
- TECHNOLOGY ADOPTION AND PRICE CURVES ARE EXPONENTIAL IN NATURE, AND THIS UNDERSTANDING IS NOT CONSENSUS.

ANYWAYS, I EXPECT TO BE DOWNVOTED SO WHATEVER. LOTS OF HATERS AND PEOPLE WHO DON‚ÄôT CARE TO SEE IT OR UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE LOOKING AT A ONCE IN A GENERATION TYPE OF COMPANY. 

NOTE: I AM OBVIOUSLY A TSLA SHAREHOLDER, BUT DO NOT OWN ANY OTHER CONSUMER EV STOCKS BECAUSE ALL OF THOSE ARE OVERVALUED IMHO. AND LEGACY IS TOO FAR BEHIND &AMP; ENCUMBERED, SO TOO MUCH UNCERTAINTY THERE.",hmk53oa,t3_r4zmc0,1638209977,1638235177.0,/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/r4zmc0/tsla/hmk53oa/

I KNOW MOST PEOPLE ON REDDIT LIKE WSB TALK ABOUT BIG RETURNS SO SMALL GAINS PLAYS LIKE THIS MAY BE ANTITHETICAL TO THAT WHOLE SCENE BUT I'M JUST CURIOUS WHERE PEOPLE STAND ON BEVERAGE AS A WHOLE.   I DON'T KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES THOUGH.   ARE THEY ALSO VIABLE FOR SMALL TIME INVESTORS OR PLAYERS?

&AMP;#X200B;

ALCOHOL INDUSTRY HAS BEEN WITNESSING RAMPANT DEMAND AT BARS AND RESTAURANTS, WITH THE REOPENING OF THE ON-PREMISE CHANNEL. MEANWHILE, THE DEMAND FOR ALCOHOL IN E-COMMERCE PORTALS AND OFF-PREMISE CONTINUES UNABATED. COMPANIES ARE EXPECTED TO BENEFIT FROM THE MOMENTUM IN SPIRITS AND READY-TO-DRINK (RTD) COCKTAILS. INVESTMENTS IN PRODUCT INNOVATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS BODE WELL FOR PLAYERS LIKE DIAGEO PLC DEO, CONSTELLATION BRANDS INC. STZ, MOLSON COORS BEVERAGE COMPANY TAP AND THE DUCKHORN PORTFOLIO NAPA.

THOUGH THE DEMAND ENVIRONMENT REMAINS ROBUST, COMPANIES ARE STRUGGLING TO MEET THE DEMAND DUE TO THE ONGOING SUPPLY-CHAIN DISRUPTIONS, WHICH HAVE LED TO PRODUCT SHORTAGES DUE TO PORT CONGESTION-RELATED SUPPLY DELAYS. ESCALATED INPUT, FREIGHT AND PACKAGING COSTS ALONG WITH HIGHER ADVERTISING EXPENSES MAY CONTINUE TO BE HEADWINDS.",hl2ijo8,t3_qw8ucx,1637201959,1637227159.0,/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/qw8ucx/after_hours_discussion_thread_for_november_17_2021/hl2ijo8/

153,spaceship_telephone,CanadianInvestor,"IT DEPENDS ON THE GROWTH RATE. IF THE GROWRH RATE IS CONSTANT THEN YES IT HAS A COMPOUNDING EFFECT. IF A COMPANY MANAGES TO GROW AT AN AVERAGE OF 2% A YEAR, IT'S THE SAME AS A SAVINGS ACCOUNT. THINK OF IT:

LET P = YOUR INITIAL INVESTMENT, I  = INTEREST RATE

YEAR 1 = P * (1 + I).
YEAR 2 = YEAR 1 * (1 + I)
= P * (1 + I) * (1 + I)
YEAR 3 = YEAR 2 * (1 + I)
= P * (1 + I) * (1 + I)  * (1 + I)

YOU CAN SEE THE PATTERN, YEAR N = P * (1 + I)^N

THIS IS THE BASIC COMPOUND GROWTH FORMULA. ALL THAT MATTERS IS THE GROWTH RATE, IF A COMPANY'S STOCK PRICE TENDS TO GROW AT A CONSTANT GROWTH RATE OVER TIME THEN IT HAS A COMPOUND EFFECT ON YOUR PRINCIPAL.

THE GOAL SHOULD BE THE HIGHEST ***RISK-ADJUSTED*** RETURNS.

IF YOUR GOAL IS JUST SEEKING THE HIGHEST RETURN, WHY NOT JUST INVEST EVERYTHING IN ONE STOCK LIKE AAPL? OR TSLA? BOTH OF THOSE STOCKS HAVE COMPLETELY DOMINATED THE S&AMP;P 500.

CONSIDERING THAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RETURNS ARE GOING TO BE FOR US VS. GLOBAL STOCKS, THE OPTIMAL WAY OF MAXIMIZING RETURNS IS TO DIVERSIFY.

WHAT WE DO KNOW, BASED ON CAPE RATIOS, IS THE EXPECTED RETURNS OF US STOCKS ARE LOWER THAN THE EXPECTED RETURNS FOR GLOBAL STOCKS FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT DECADE.

227,_DotBot_,CanadianInvestor,"HI, HERE ARE SOME OF MY THOUGHTS:

XEQT IS A GREAT PICK FOR BROAD MARKET DIVERSIFICATION.

THE CANADIAN BANK STOCKS ARE SOLID PICKS IF YOU WANT MORE EXPOSURE TO THIS SECTOR THAN WHAT XEQT OFFERS BUT KEEP IN MIND THAT 25% OF XEQT IS XIC WHICH TRACKS THE TSX. CANADA'S ECONOMY IS ALREADY HEAVILY WEIGHTED TOWARDS FINANCIALS, AS IS EVIDENCED BY 32% OF XIC HOLDINGS BEING IN FINANCIALS / CANADIAN BANK STOCKS. THAT MEANS AROUND 8% OF XEQT'S TOTAL HOLDINGS ARE ALREADY CANADIAN BANKS, SO BY ADDING AN ADDITIONAL 5-10% YOUR PORTFOLIO ENDS UP BEING 13-18% IN CANADIAN BANK STOCKS. 

IN ADDITION YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF VARIOUS OTHER HOLDINGS IN VARIOUS GROWTH SPACES. SO WHY NOT JUST BUY XQQ AND TRACK THE NASDAQ 100? MANY OF THE NASDAQ 100 COMPANIES MAKE UP TOP HOLDINGS IN THOSE VARIOUS ETFS,  SO BY HOLDING THEM ACROSS NUMEROUS ETFS ALL YOU'RE DOING IS JUST PAYING LOTS OF MER FEES FOR SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT ALLOCATIONS, WHICH VERY LIKELY MAY NOT OUTPERFORM THE NASDAQ 100 INDEX IN THE LONG RUN.

EDGE, CWW, XHC, ZCLN, TSLA, CHPS, COULD ALL BE REPLACED BY XQQ. FROM THE LOOKS OF IT YOU WANT EXPOSURE TO FUTURE GROWTH TECH STOCKS AND INNOVATIVE COMPANIES. AND BY BUYING AN INDEX OF 100 COMPANIES THAT COMPETE IN THOSE SPACES, YOU'LL BE CUTTING DOWN ON ETF MER FEES AND LIKELY OUTPERFORM ALL OF THOSE ETFS IN THE LONG RUN TOO.

ZRE IS IN REITS, AND IN MY OPINION IT'S GOOD TO HAVE REAL-ESTATE EXPOSURE, SO I'D KEEP HOLDING.

&AMP;#X200B;

BUT OVERALL, YOU COULD REALLY SIMPLIFY YOUR PORTFOLIO BY CONSIDERING THE FOLLOWING ALLOCATION:

60% - XEQT

25% - XQQ

5% - TSLA (KEEP HOLDING IF YOU ARE VERY HIGH CONVICTION, BUT MIND YOU IT'S A TOP HOLDING IN XQQ TOO)

5% - ZRE

HI, I‚ÄôM VERY NEW TO INVESTING. I LIKE TO THINK I UNDERSTAND SOME STUFF. I‚ÄôVE DONE QUITE A BIT OF RESEARCH BEFORE INVESTING INTO THESE ETFS. BUT, I JUST FEEL LIKE I NEED SOME (OR MANY) PAIRS OF SEASONED EYES TO DISSECT MY PORTFOLIO.   
I ADDED A QUICK SUMMARY FOR EACH INVESTMENT JUST TO MAKE THINGS AS EASY AS POSSIBLE FOR ANY ADVICE-GIVERS. MOST OF Y‚ÄôALL PROBABLY WON‚ÄôT NEED IT, BUT, IT‚ÄôS THERE IF YOU NEED A QUICK REMINDER.

(RDS 20%, XOM 28%, IMO 7%, XLE 28%, CNQ IS AN ODD DUCK AT 100% OVER PAST 10 YEAR \[ FOR ITS OWN REASONS \])

OH WAIT... [DIVIDENDS](HTTPS://WWW.SUNCOR.COM/EN-CA/INVESTOR-CENTRE/STOCK-INFORMATION/DIVIDENDS). A SINGLE SHARE PAYING OUT... WHAT IS THAT? $10.87/SHARE IN DIVIDENDS OVER THE PAST 10 YEARS? BITCH, GET ON THE BED YOU ARE SLEEPING WITH PAPA.

($26.51 TODAY + $10.87 IN DIVIDENDS) / $19.33 10 YEARS AGO - 1 = .93 (93%)

I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOUR PERFORMANCE BUT A DOUBLE IN 10 YEARS IS NOT TOO SHABBY. ITS ABOUT 7.5% ANNUAL RETURN (KEEPING IN MIND MY EXAMPLE DIDN'T COMPOUND). YES THIS IS JUST KEEPING UP WITH THE MARKET, WHICH ISN'T BAD CONSIDERING WE ARE PICKING RANDOM SPOTS.

SINCE WE ARE INVESTORS, WE BUY WE WHEN THINK THERE IS MORE POTENTIAL UPSIDE. THERE IS PLENTY OF ROOM FOR SUNCOR TO GO BACK TO WHERE THEY WERE, AND PERSONALLY I CAN SAY I'M COOL WAITING AND I AM LOADED UP IN THE MEANTIME.

YES ITS NO TSLA OR GME, THIS IS ONE OF THE CORE FOUNDATIONS OF THE COUNTRY/INDEX HOWEVER YOU WANT TO SLICE IT. WHY? CAUSE THEY FUCKING MAKE MONEY. TERRIBLE DIVIDEND INCREASES?

I OPENED AN INVESTMENT ACCOUNT WITH CIBC AND HAVE DRAFTED MY PORTFOLIO (BELOW). I BASED THIS OFF OF ADVICE FROM FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES. I HAVE NOT ACTUALLY INVESTED THE MONEY YET, BUT PLAN TO START THIS MORNING WHEN THE MARKET OPENS. 
I HAVE $65,000 TO INVEST. I DON‚ÄôT HAVE CLEAR CUT INVESTMENT GOALS. I PLAN ON STARTING MY MASTERS IN THE NEXT YEAR (COST $18,000 OVER 3 YEARS). I MAY WANT TO BUY A SECOND HOME AT SOME POINT IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS AS WELL.

288,3rdFire,CanadianInvestor,"NOT AN INVESTOR IN LION AT THIS VERY MOMENT BUT FOLLOW THE SPACE QUITE CLOSELY, SO FIGURED I‚ÄôD DO SOME NAPKIN MATH TO COMPARE AND TO TAKE A LOOK.

 SEEMS LIKE LION IS GROWING HEALTHILY AND GETTING TO SCALE, WHICH IS GREAT. DIDN‚ÄôT TAKE A DEEPER LOOK TO SEE WHAT THEIR LIMITING FACTOR FOR GROWTH IS, BUT I‚ÄôD HARBINGER A GUESS THAT IT COMES DOWN TO ACCESS TO BATTERY CELLS (AND HAVING A RELIABLE FLOW OF THEM THAT SCALES TO ORDER BOOK SIZE). 

MY NAPKIN MATH FOR EVS STOCKS:

NORMALIZE FORWARD ANNUAL GROSS PROFIT , TAKE SIMILAR GROWTH RATE AND COMPARE TO MARKET CAP.  I GET TO ABOUT ~550X FOR LION, AND ~12X FOR TESLA. SO EVEN THOUGH EVERYONE IS STOMPING ABOUT COMPLAINING ABOUT TESLA‚ÄôS VALUATIONS, SEEMS LIKE DOLLAR PER DOLLAR OF GROSS MARGIN ALL EV PROPERTIES BEING EQUAL, LION IS PROBABLY ~45X-50X OVERVALUED. THAT‚ÄôS JARRING, BUT WHEN I THINK ABOUT IT MORE IT MAKES SENSE.

[LION] QUARTERLY GROSS PROFIT ~ 1MIL/QUARTER, MARKET CAP 3,400M. ASSUME GROSS PROFIT &AMP; MARGIN IS MAINTAINED AND THERE IS A 50%ISH CAGR. SO, LET‚ÄôS SAY 6MIL GROSS PROFIT 12 MONTHS FORWARD, 3400/6=~550X.
[TESLA] QUARTERLY GROSS PROFIT ~ 6.6 &AMP; 9.2B RESPECTIVELY. SO TAKE 9.2, AND LET‚ÄôS SAY 12B FOR NEXT, 14B FOR THE NEXT, AND 16B FOR THE FOLLOWING FOR 12 MONTH CUMULATIVE TOTAL OF $51B PROBABLE FORWARD GROSS PROFIT. THEIR MARKET CAP IS $650B, SO ENDS UP BEING ABOUT 12X.

THERE ARE MANY REASONS I‚ÄôD SAY GROSS PROFIT AND OVERALL GROWTH AND ABILITY SCALE ARE WHAT MATTERS IN THE SPACES. AT THIS POINT, I SEE IT HARD TO JUSTIFY ME BUYING LION OVER ADDING TO MY TSLA POSITION. IF LION IS FAIRLY VALUED, THAT WOULD INDICATE TESLA HAS 45X-50X UPSIDE, WHICH IRONICALLY FITS WITH MY LONG TERM MODELS AND THINKING ON TESLA (2 DECADES). SIMILARLY, LION WOULD PROBABLY NEED TO EXPERIENCE A 90% DROP FROM TODAY‚ÄôS LEVELS FOR ME TO CONSIDER ADDING AND DIVERSIFYING MY EV POSITION.",h8s2xoy,t3_p3l7if,1628860044,1628885244.0,/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/p3l7if/lionelectricannouncessecondquarter2021results2021/h8s2xoy/

293,Im_int,CanadianInvestor,"I OWN PRIMARILY TECH STOCKS, SO MY METHOD IS SPECIFIC TO THAT. I START BY EVALUATING THE COOLNESS FACTOR. A LOT OF COMPANIES AREN'T FINANCIALLY SUCCESSFUL (AT LEAST YET), BUT THEY THEY DO SOMETHING ON THE LEADING EDGE. BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR ME. I WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY OFFER SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA BE THE NEXT THING. 

TELLING EVERYONE YOU HAVE A UNIQUE PRODUCT ISN'T ENOUGH. IT HAS TO BE MARKETABLE AND LEGIT. REMEMBER LEAP MOTION? IT WAS COOL, IT SEEMED LIKE SOMETHING USEFUL, BUT AT THE END IT WAS JUST A FANCY TOY. REMEMBER DDD? BACK IN THE DAY 3D PRINTING WAS THE COOLEST THING EVER! AND DDD HAD ALL THE COOL PATENTS. SAFE BET? NOPE. HAVING COOL IP ISN'T THE SAME AS HAVING A MARKETABLE PRODUCT! AS A TECH PERSON MYSELF, I CAN COME UP WITH A HUNDRED PATENTS FOR STATE-OF-THE-ART STUFF, BUT I CAN PRETTY MUCH GUARANTEE ALL OF THEM WILL FAIL TO BECOME COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS.

NOW, SAY THE COMPANY ACTUALLY HAS SOMETHING THAT SEEMS LIKE A COOL AND MARKETABLE PRODUCT... IT'S TIME TO VISIT GLASSDOOR. ARE THE EMPLOYEES HAPPY WITH THE COMPANY? NO? WELL, TOO BAD, I WON'T INVEST IN SOMETHING THAT HAS A SCHISM GROWING WITHIN. SOME DISSENT IS NORMAL. A LOT OF DISSENT? THAT MEANS THE COMPANY IS FAILING AS A BUSINESS. IT'S A FRAUD. DON'T TOUCH IT.

SO FAR SO GOOD. BUT WHAT IF I WANT TO MAKE SURE I'LL SEE GOOD RETURNS BEFORE I DIE? WELL, IT HELPS TO SEE WHERE THE COMPANY IS NOW. TSLA, FOR EXAMPLE, MAY BE AN AWESOME STOCK, BUT IT'S ALSO RISKY BECAUSE THE COMPANY HASN'T QUITE FIGURED OUT MASS-PRODUCTION. MAYBE THEY'LL GET THERE, MAYBE NOT. YOU DECIDE HOW MUCH RISK YOUR ARE WILLING TO TAKE. APPLE IS A GOOD COUNTER-EXAMPLE. THE COMPANY DOESN'T JUST SAY THEY'LL BE MAKING A BRAD NEW TYPE OF LAPTOP. THEY ACTUALLY MAKE THIS PRODUCT ALREADY!

320,Shoopshopship,CanadianInvestor,"CANADIAN IMPERIAL BANK OF COMMERCE CM-T +0.42%INCREASE
IS LAUNCHING CANADA‚ÄôS FIRST DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS LINKED TO U.S. STOCKS, CREATING A NEW WAY FOR RETAIL INVESTORS TO TRADE IN LARGE AMERICAN COMPANIES WITHOUT THE FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK INHERENT IN BUYING THOSE SHARES DIRECTLY.

CIBC‚ÄôS FIRST BATCH OF CANADIAN DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS (CDRS) WILL BE TIED TO AMAZON.COM INC.‚ÄôS AMZN-Q +0.51%INCREASE
STOCK AND IS EXPECTED TO START TRADING ON TUESDAY ON THE NEO EXCHANGE. THE CDRS ARE MODELLED AFTER U.S. DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS (ADRS), A TRILLION-DOLLAR MARKET THAT HAS EXISTED FOR DECADES SOUTH OF THE BORDER AS AN ALTERNATIVE WAY TO ACCESS FOREIGN COMPANIES‚Äô STOCKS, BUT WHICH HAD NO DIRECT EQUIVALENT IN CANADA.

DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS ARE A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT ISSUED BY BANKS THAT REPRESENT A CERTAIN NUMBER OF SHARES IN A COMPANY THAT IS LISTED AND TRADED ABROAD, ALLOWING DOMESTIC INVESTORS TO HAVE EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN STOCKS WITHOUT BUYING THEM DIRECTLY ON A FOREIGN STOCK EXCHANGE. WITH THE POPULARITY OF DO-IT-YOURSELF INVESTING SURGING IN THE PANDEMIC AND BROAD-BASED INTEREST IN PROMINENT U.S. STOCKS, ESPECIALLY IN THE TECHNOLOGY SECTOR, CDRS CAN GIVE CANADIAN INVESTORS A LOW-COST WAY TO TRADE IN U.S. STOCKS THAT SIDESTEPS POTENTIAL DRAWBACKS FROM FLUCTUATING CURRENCIES.

THE KEY FEATURE OF THE NEW CDRS IS THAT THEY HAVE A BUILT-IN HEDGE AGAINST CHANGING FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, ELIMINATING THE RISK THAT A CANADIAN INVESTOR‚ÄôS RETURN ON A U.S. STOCK WILL BE EATEN AWAY BY MOVES IN THE RELATIVE VALUE OF THE TWO COUNTRIES‚Äô DOLLARS.

MANY CANADIAN INVESTMENT PORTFOLIOS ARE LOADED WITH DOMESTIC EQUITIES, AND CDRS OFFER AN OPTION TO DIVERSIFY THOSE HOLDINGS, BUT TO ‚ÄúOWN THE COMPANY, NOT THE CURRENCY,‚Äù ELLIOT SCHERER, MANAGING DIRECTOR IN THE WEALTH SOLUTIONS GROUP AT CIBC WORLD MARKETS INC., SAID IN AN INTERVIEW.

AS ONE RECENT EXAMPLE, THE CANADIAN DOLLAR STRENGTHENED BY MORE THAN 10 PER CENT RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR BETWEEN JULY, 2020, AND MAY THIS YEAR, WEAKENING THE RETURNS SOME INVESTORS EARNED ON U.S. STOCKS.

‚ÄúIF YOU‚ÄôRE A CANADIAN AND YOU‚ÄôRE INVESTING IN U.S. SHARES DURING THAT PERIOD, YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN PRETTY DISAPPOINTED. YOU‚ÄôD SEE THE S&AMP;P 500 HITTING NEW HIGHS ALL THE TIME, AND YET YOU‚ÄôRE NOT SEEING THAT FULL GAIN IN THE CANADIAN-DOLLAR RETURN IN YOUR PORTFOLIO,‚Äù MR. SCHERER SAID. ‚ÄúINVESTMENT ADVISERS WOULD OFTEN VENT ABOUT THIS ISSUE TO MY TEAM.‚Äù

IT TOOK CIBC THREE YEARS TO DEVELOP AND LAUNCH CDRS, WITH A TEAM THAT INCLUDED TRADERS, ENGINEERS AND A LAWYER. THE BANK ALSO HAD TO GET APPROVAL FROM THE ONTARIO SECURITIES COMMISSION. AND IT CHOSE THE RELATIVELY YOUNG NEO EXCHANGE AS ITS LISTING PARTNER FOR ITS EXPERIENCE IN THE EXCHANGE-TRADED FUND MARKET AND ITS REPUTATION AS FAST-MOVING AND OPEN TO NEW IDEAS, MR. SCHERER SAID.

THE CDRS ALSO TAP INTO ANOTHER GROWING TREND: TRADING IN FRACTIONAL SHARES, WHICH MAKES COMPANIES WITH HIGH SHARE PRICES MORE ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYDAY INVESTORS. THE CDRS WILL INITIALLY BE PRICED AT $20 EACH, WHICH WOULD ALLOW A CUSTOMER TO EFFECTIVELY OWN A SMALL SLICE OF A SHARE IN AMAZON.COM, WHICH COST US$3,656.64 AS OF THE MARKET CLOSE ON FRIDAY.

BEFORE LONG, CIBC PLANS TO INTRODUCE CDRS TIED TO ALPHABET INC. GOOG-Q +3.37%INCREASE
, THE PARENT COMPANY OF GOOGLE, AS WELL AS APPLE INC. AAPL-Q +1.20%INCREASE
, NETFLIX INC. NFLX-Q +0.71%INCREASE
AND TESLA INC. TSLA-Q -0.91%DECREASE
. OVER THE COMING MONTHS, THE BANK IS SET TO EXPAND ITS CDR LISTINGS TO INCLUDE OTHER PROMINENT S&AMP;P 500 COMPANIES.

‚ÄúIT‚ÄôS THE RIGHT MOMENT,‚Äù JOS SCHMITT, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF NEO GROUP, SAID IN AN INTERVIEW. ‚ÄúCIBC FOUND A GREAT GAP AND OPPORTUNITY IN THE MARKET.‚Äù

THE CDRS TRADE IN CANADIAN DOLLARS, AND CIBC ADJUSTS THE RATIO OF DEPOSITARY RECEIPTS TO COMPANY SHARES DAILY TO ACCOUNT FOR CHANGES IN CURRENCY VALUES. THE BANK CHARGES NO MANAGEMENT FEES FOR CDRS, BUT EARNS SMALL FEES FROM THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTIONS IT MAKES IN THE BACKGROUND TO MANAGE THE CURRENCY HEDGE FOR INVESTORS. THE MAXIMUM SPREAD BETWEEN RATES THAT CIBC CAN COLLECT FROM THOSE TRANSACTIONS IS CAPPED AT 60 BASIS POINTS ON AN ANNUALIZED BASIS. CIBC MELLON WILL ACT AS THE CUSTODIAN BANK.

MR. SCHERER AND MR. SCHMITT EXPECT EARLY INTEREST IN CDRS TO COME MOSTLY FROM DO-IT-YOURSELF INVESTORS AND INVESTMENT ADVISERS. BUT THEY ALSO ANTICIPATE THERE COULD BE DEMAND FROM HIGH NET WORTH INVESTORS, SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS AND FAMILY OFFICES.

IF CIBC‚ÄôS CDRS ARE POPULAR, THE BANK ANTICIPATES THAT COMPETITORS WILL RESPOND. NOW THAT CIBC HAS LAID THE REGULATORY GROUNDWORK, OTHER BANKS COULD OFFER THEIR OWN CDRS. AND ONLINE RIVAL WEALTHSIMPLE RECENTLY STARTED ALLOWING CLIENTS OF ITS TRADING PRODUCT TO BUY FRACTIONAL SHARES IN CERTAIN CANADIAN AND U.S. COMPANIES, INCLUDING THE SAME FIVE STOCKS INCLUDED IN CIBC‚ÄôS LAUNCH OF CDRS.

‚ÄúI THINK YOU HAVE TO BE REALISTIC. WHEN SOMEONE COMES WITH A GOOD AND UNIQUE IDEA, COMPETITION IS GOING TO FOLLOW,‚Äù MR. SCHMITT SAID.",h6kmjj4,t3_orw4vd,1627296047,1627321247.0,/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/orw4vd/cibc_launching_trading_of_american_companies_on/h6kmjj4/

I DON'T HAVE MANY GOALS AT THE MOMENT. I HAVE STUDENT DEBT OF 17K, BUT THE INTEREST RATE IS 2.95%, AND WILL BE APPLIED IN MARCH 2022

MONTHLY EXPENSES: $50 - $100/MONTH  
SHOPPING/DISCRETIONARY SPENDING: $0 - $500/MONTH 

EMERGENCY ACCOUNT: $1,500 (HISA 1.15% INTEREST), WILL PLAN TO INCREASE IT TO 5K BY SEPTEMBER

374,MRobi83,CanadianInvestor,"YOU'RE SPEAKING AS IF A DRIP ALWAYS BUYS ADDITIONAL SHARES WHEN THE PRICE IS LOW. THAT'S SIMPLY NOT HOW IT WORKS.

YES IF YOU HAVE $100 TO INVEST AND YOU INVEST IT WHEN THE SHARE PRICE IS $10 VS $15 YOU WILL GET MORE SHARES. BUT IF YOU RECEIVE THAT $100 IN A DRIP WHEN THE PRICE IS $15, THE MONEY ISN'T GOING TO SIT THERE AND WAIT FOR IT TO GET BACK TO $10 TO BE RE-INVESTED. THE FACT IS, YOU HAVE ZERO CONTROL ON WHEN THAT DRIP GETS RE-INVESTED. IT COULD GET IN ON A MOMENTARY DIP AND THE STOCK IS TRADING AT $8, OR IT COULD GET IN ON A MOMENTARY RISE WHEN THE STOCK IS TRADING AT $18. IT'S AUTOMATIC SO YOU CAN'T CONTROL IT.

HERE'S A VERY SIMPLE AND FICTIONAL EXAMPLE FOR YOU.... LET'S SAY YOU HOLD BOTH AAPL AND TSLA. ARGUABLY BOTH GOOD STOCKS TO OWN AND LIKELY TO HOLD. YOU'RE NOT LOOKING TO SELL EITHER. AAPL PAYS A SMALL DIVIDEND, TSLA PAYS NONE. WHEN THE DIVIDEND FROM AAPL PAYS OUT, TSLA HAPPENS TO BE AT IT'S LOWEST POINT OF THE YEAR IN AND AROUND $560, MEANWHILE AAPL IS TRADING NEAR IT'S ATH OF $145. IF YOU THINK BOTH ARE GOOD COMPANIES TO HOLD LONG TERM, WOULDN'T YOU THINK IT MAKES MOST SENSE TO PUT YOUR AVAILABLE MONEY INTO STRENGTHENING YOUR POSITION IN TSLA WHILE IT'S LOW INSTEAD OF BUYING MORE AAPL WHILE IT'S AT IT'S RECORD HIGH? NOW THE REVERSE COULD ALSO BE TRUE. AAPL COULD PAY OUT IT'S DIVIDEND WHILE IT'S TRADING AROUND $110 AND TSLA IS APPROACHING $900. IN THIS CASE, IT WOULD MAKE MOST SENSE TO PUT THAT MONEY INTO MORE AAPL.  

THIS EXAMPLE IS NOT SOME IRRELEVANT EDGE CASE. THIS EXAMPLE HAPPENS EVERY SINGLE DAY WHERE THERE ARE PRIME BUYING OPPORTUNITIES. I WOULD PERSONALLY RATHER POSITION MYSELF TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES RATHER THAN BEING FORCED TO FURTHER BUY INTO A COMPANY. 

IF YOU CONTRIBUTE $1,000 ON THE 1ST DAY OF EVERY MONTH AND YOU DIRECT THAT $1,000 INTO THE FUNDS OF YOUR CHOICE, WHY SHOULD IT MATTER IF THAT $1,000 CAME FROM YOUR CHEQUING ACCOUNT OR FROM A DIVIDEND PAYMENT?

423,BCRE8TVE,CanadianInvestor,"&GT; I THINK A BIT OF RISK ISN'T NECESSARILY GAMBLING, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG AND YOUR RISK TOLERANCE CAN AND SHOULD BE HIGHER. IT'S AN APPROPRIATE STRATEGY WHEN YOU'RE NOT CLOSING IN ON RETIREMENT.

OH FOR SURE. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RISK AND GAMBLING IS THAT WITH RISK, YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE RISKING, AND YOU'RE OK WITH LOSING IT. IT'S MORE OF A COLD, DETACHED, RATIONAL COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS. GAMBLING IS MUCH MORE FUN, BECAUSE IT'S ABOUT FUN, IT'S NOT ABOUT MAKING PROFIT-BASED COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS.

I'M 100% IN EQUITIES BECAUSE MY PORTFOLIO IS FOR RETIREMENT IN 30 YEARS. I DON'T CARE IF MY PORTFOLIO DROPS BY HALF TOMORROW, BECAUSE I'M NOT GOING TO BE SELLING FOR DECADES. 

&GT;AS A BONUS, TAKING A BIT OF RISK AND LEARNING HOW THE MARKET WORKS, OR INVESTING IN COMPANIES YOU KNOW/FOLLOW AND PROBABLY USE THEIR PRODUCTS EVERY DAY (APPLE OR MICROSOFT ARE EASY EXAMPLES) IS KEY TO GETTING YOU INTERESTED AND LEARNING SO THAT YOU STICK WITH IT FOR LIFE. COMPANIES LIKE THAT ARE ALL FAIRLY SAFE BETS AND PROBABLY MARKET LEADERS IF YOU'RE USING THEIR PRODUCTS AND IF IT GETS YOU INTERESTED IN INVESTING SO THAT IT'S SOMETHING YOU ARE COMMITTED TO THE REST OF YOUR LIFE IT'S WELL WORTH IT.

I CAN'T REALLY DISAGREE WITH THAT WHEN I GOT ONE SHARE OF TSLA AT 200$ PRE-SPLIT ;)

496,slam_to,CanadianInvestor,"THIS IS A GREAT IDEA, THERE'S ALWAYS SOMETHING TO LEARN, AND I'VE NEVER HAD ANYONE REVIEW MY PORTFOLIO OR INVESTING STRATEGY.  SO I'M 48.  I'M A LONG TERM INVESTOR.  TIME HORIZON IS 10+ YEARS.   
 WENT THROUGH THE DOT.COM BUBBLE, AND GOT KILLED IN 2008 (PORTFOLIO FELL 65%, AND I GOT A MARGIN CALL!).  

ACROSS ALL MY ACCOUNTS (EQUITY, RRSP, TFSA) (MAY NOT ADD UP TO 100%):  
(COMPANY I WORK FOR) 3.4% - (I WON'T SAY DUE TO POSSIBLE CONFLICT OF INTEREST)  
AAPL: 8.5% - A FRUIT COMPANY  
ARKK: 16.2% - ARK INNOVATION ETF IN EQUITY AND RRSP, NOT IN TFSA FOR WITHOLDING TAX REASONS  
BCE 2.0% - IN A DRIP, HAVE THIS FOR DECADES  
BITCOIN 0.3% - ACTUAL BITCOIN  
BMO: 2.4% - IN A DRIP, HELD FOR DECADES, CANADIAN BANK  
BNS: 3.7% - IN A DRIP, HELD FOR DECADES, CANADIAN BANK  
BTCC.B: 0.5% - IN MY TFSA, ONLY WAY TO GET BITCOIN IN THERE, WENT UNHEADGED, I WANT EXPOSURE TO ALL THE RISK   
CASH: 15-20% IN RRSP &AMP; TFSA  
CSU: 8.9% - SOFTWARE COMPANY  
KO: 0.5% - I DRINK ENOUGH COKE I PROBABLY SHOULD GET SOMETHING BACK, ALSO IN A DRIP  
SPCE 0.9% - VIRGIN GALACTIC, I THREW SOME BILLS TO SEE IF ANYTHING STUCK  
TD: 8.9% - CANADIAN BANK  
TSLA 21.5% - TESLA, NOT MUCH ELSE TO SAY  
XGB: 3.5% - BOND FUND TO PARK HALF MY CASH   
XRE: 3.0% - REIT  
ZLB: 8.0% - LOW VOLATILITY CANADIAN ETF, THE GO-TO HOLDING TO PARK EXTRA CASH  


I ACTIVELY REBALANCE MY PORTFOLIO, WITH NO SPECIFIC TIME PERIOD.  I REBALANCE WHEN ONE OF MY HOLDINGS (INCLUDING CASH) EXCEEDS A CERTAIN PREDETERMINED PERCENTAGE OF MY PORTFOLIO.  I HAVE IT AT 1-20% DEPENDING ON WHAT TYPE OF HOLDING/HOLDINGS.  IE. 20% FOR TSLA, BUT 1% FOR SPCE, 15% FOR BMO+BNS+TD.   THIS ENDS UP GETTING ME TO BUY ON DIPS, SELL HIGH (WHEN ONE OF MY HOLDINGS EXCEEDS THAT PERCENTAGE THRESHOLD).  I ALWAYS MAINTAIN AT MINIMUM 15% CASH.  ANY DIVIDENDS OR INTEREST ARE PUT INTO THE CASH PILE IF THEY ARE NOT PART OF A DRIP.  IF THERE IS A STOCK MARKET CRASH (LIKE IN MARH 2020), I DROP MY CASH RESERVES DOWN TO 10% TEMPORARILY.  


I NEVER TRADE ON MARGIN.  I DON'T DARE DABBLE IN DERIVATIVES AND OPTIONS.  


FOR FOREX I DO A ""NORBERT'S GAMBIT"" TO SAVE ON THE FOREX PREMIUMS MY TRADING PLATFORM CHARGES.    


ANY LOANS I TAKE OUT FOR OTHER THINGS, I DO A ""SMITH MANOEUVRE"" TO MAKE IT SO THAT I CAN CLAIM THE INTEREST I PAY AGAINST MY INCOME, COME TAX SEASON.",gqight1,t3_lufg2f,1615422065,1615447265.0,/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/lufg2f/rate_my_portfolio_megathread_for_march_2021/gqight1/

THE MAIN POINT OF BUILDING YOUR LONG TERM POSITIONS IS SO YOU LET THEM GROW FOR A YEAR, TAKE SOME PROFITS AND INVEST ON OTHER COMPANIES. SPECULATIVE INVESTMENTS ARE WHEN YOU ALREADY SET UP A PORTFOLIO GENERATING INCOME. YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT FRESH MONEY ON SPECULATIVE STOCKS. YOU WANT MONEY YOU ALREADY GAINED TOWARDS THEM. IF YOU ARE PUTTING FRESH MONEY EVERYTIME ON RISKY STOCKS, IT KINDA BEATS THE PURPOSE OF GROWING YOUR PORTFOLIO. IT TAKES TIME TO BUILD A PORTFOLIO AS YOU NEED AT LEAST A FEW YEARS TO NOTICE THE MATURITY. AVERAGELY, IT TAKES AT KEAST 7 YEARS BEFORE YOUR PORTFOLIO IS MATURE ENOUGH TILL YOU CAN HAVE EXTRA GAMBLING MONEY. MOST PEOPLE WHO HAVE CASH FOR SPECULATIVE STOCKS ARE THE ONES THAT PUTS A LOT OF CASH IN THEIR INVESTMENT ACCOUNTS EVERY MONTH. YOU CAN INVEST ON AN ETF OR A GOOD GROWTH COMPANY. GOOD STOCKS ARE EXPENSIVE BUT THEY DO GROW. CHEAP STOCKS CAN GO UP VERY FAST BUT CAN ALSO GO DOWN VERY FAST. GET TO KNOW THE STOCK YOU ARE INVESTING IN. FOLLOW IT. SEE HIW IT REACTS TO NEWS AND UNDERSTAND HOW IT GOES UP OR DOWN. IF YOU INVEST ON TOO MANY STOCKS AT FIRST, IT'S REALLY HARD TO KEEP UP. YOU CAN WATCH YOUTUBE AND READ ARTICLES ABOUT YOUR STOCK. SEE OTHER PEOPLE'S ANALYSIS AND OPINION ABOUT TGE STOCK. JUST AVOID THE ONES GIVING TOO MUCH POSITIVITY BUT NO RESEARCH TO BACK THEM UP.

I BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE WRONG LONG TERM ESPECIALLY ON A COMPANY LIKE TESLA.   AND MY TRACK RECORD ON THIS IS PRETTY GOOD.    BASICALLY MY PLAY HAS BEEN 100 PERCENT CORRECT UP UNTIL THIS POINT SINCE I CHANGED INVESTMENT STRATEGIES 4 YEARS AGO.  NOW PAST TRACK RECORD DOESN'T MEAN FUTURE BUT NOTHING I SEE FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGES THAT.  IN FACT I BELIEVE IN IT EVEN MORE BECAUSE OF WHAT I AM SEEING TODAY.   THAT IS ALSO THE BENEFIT OF GETTING IN EARLY AND HAVING MASSIVE GAINS.   YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT EVEN MAJOR FLUCTUATIONS IN SHARE PRICE AND ALL OF THEM JUST BECOME A BUYING OPPORTUNITY LIKE THE MARCH 2020 CRASH CAUSED BY THE PANDEMIC.   IN THE END THERE WERE PEOPLE JUST LIKE YOU SAYING THEN NOT TO BUY.   IT IS EASY TO LOOK BACK AND SEE WHO WAS RIGHT AND WHO WAS WRONG.    I ADDED SIGNIFICANTLY TO MY POSITION AT THAT TIME AND WAS REWARDED MASSIVELY FOR THE MOVE.   

THIS IS MUCH DIFFERENT THEN JUMPING IN ON WEED STOCKS AFTER A LARGE SPECULATIVE RISE.    NOW IF I WAS A NEW INVESTOR IS BUYING INTO TESLA NOW A GOOD IDEA?   THAT REALLY DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU BELIEVE AND YOUR LONG TERM GOALS.   I HAVE LEARNED THAT YOU CAN'T INVEST FOR PEOPLE.    IN THE END WHAT THEY DO WILL DO IS BASED ON THEIR OWN FEELINGS.   IF I RECOMMENDED TSLA TO A FAMILY MEMBER IN MARCH AND THEY ACTUALLY BOUGHT WOULD THEY OF HELD THROUGH A 100, 200 500% GAIN THAT ENDED UP HAPPENING?   PROBABLY NOT SINCE IN ORDER TO HOLD LONG THERM THROUGH GAINS LIKE THAT YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT IN THE FUTURE THOSE GAINS WILL BE EVEN HIGHER.   THIS IS WHY INVESTING LIKE THIS IS NOT LUCK.   IT TAKES MASSIVE PATIENCE AND CONVICTION TO HOLD WHEN 95% OF OTHER PEOPLE ARE TELLING YOU TO SELL.   IT IS CONVICTION AND BELIEF THAT MAKES PEOPLE FORTUNES.   BUT LIKE ANYTHING IT CAN BE STRONG CONVICTIONS THAT ALSO LEAD TO PEOPLE LOSING A FORTUNE (SEE TESLA SHORTS OVER THE LAST YEARS AS AN EXAMPLE).   IN THE END YOU WILL HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF ABOUT WHETHER YOU WERE CORRECT OR NOT IN YOUR EVALUATIONS.",gk2gbl5,t3_l1po83,1611242382,1611267582.0,/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/l1po83/for_those_interested_in_the_evrenewables_sector/gk2gbl5/

693,zombienudist,CanadianInvestor,"EVERYONE HAS A STORY LIKE THIS.  THE BEST THING THAT CAN HAPPENS IS YOU GET KICKED IN THE TEETH A FEW TIMES TO LEARN THAT IF YOU TIME THE TOP AND BOTTOM SHORT TERM IT IS MOSTLY JUST LUCK.   WHEN YOU HAVE SUCCESS YOU START TO THINK IT IS ALL YOU AND MIGHT TAKE BIGGER AND BIGGER RISKS.

I HAVE LEARNED THAT YOU CANNOT HOLD 50 DIFFERENT COMPANIES AND KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THEM TO KNOW WHETHER TO SELL OR BUY.    MOST PEOPLE ARE JUST GOING ON ADVICE OR GUT FEELINGS INSTEAD OF REALLY DOING DD.

IN MY CASE I MADE TWO MOVES THAT MADE ME NOT TRY AND PLAY THAT GAME ANYMORE OF TRYING TO TIME THE MARKET.    BOTH WERE MOVES WITH TSLA.   TWICE I SOLD THINKING I COULD SELL HIGH AND BUY MORE AFTER IT FEEL.   BROKE EVEN THE FIRST TIME.   TRIED IT ONE MORE TIME AND LOST 5 SHARES.   THAT IS 5 SHARES PRE SPLIT.    SO IF I HELD TO TODAY THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN 25 SHARES WORTH $26,500 CAD.

I LEARNED SOMETHING ABOUT MYSELF AS AN INVESTOR.  I AM NOT A TRADER.    I PICK INDIVIDUAL STOCKS TO BUY THAT I WANT TO HOLD LONG TERM AND THINK THERE IS A BIG UPSIDE.   MY INITIAL GOAL WITH TSLA WAS THAT BUT I GOT GREEDY.    I WAS ALREADY UP QUITE A BIT AT THE POINT AND THOUGHT MY SUCCESS WAS TRANSFERABLE TO A DIFFERENT KIND OF TRADING.   SO I LEARNED MY LESSON.   NOW I INVESTIGATE THE COMPANY AND BUY AND HOLD.   I MAKE A PRICE TARGET AND UNDERSTAND THE FUNDAMENTALS (AS I SEE THEM).    THEN I DON'T SELL UNLESS I HIT MY PRICE TARGET OR SOMETHING FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES IN THE BUSINESS.  SO NOW I JUST HOLD MY CORE POSITION AND ADD TO IT ON DIPS IF I HAVE THE CASH.   THAT STRATEGY HAS WORKED OUT VERY WELL (EXPECT FOR LOSING 25 SHARES).

SO IN THE END YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT KIND OF INVESTOR YOU ARE.  IF YOU ARE A TRADER AND JUST LOOKING FOR AN UPSWING AND THEN GET OUT FOR PROFIT YOU CANNOT LOOK BACK AT TRADES LIKE THAT.   PROFIT IS PROFIT.   AND HINDSIGHT IS 20/20.

\- THE 40 HOLDINGS CONTAIN MOST OF THE GLOBAL LEADERS IN RENEWABLE POWER GENERATION WITH A NOTABLE EXCLUSION OF NEXTERA ENERGY. THE OVERLAPPING HOLDINGS WITH ICLN LOOK GOOD.

719,zombienudist,CanadianInvestor,"THAT IS BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T REALLY BELIEVE IN THE COMPANY OR THE FUTURE OR YOU DIDN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT INVESTMENT STYLE IS BEST FOR YOU.  I WAS THE SAME WAY.   WHEN I FIRST INVESTED IN TSLA ANY AMOUNT OF VOLATILITY I FREAKED OUT.    BUT I LEARNED MY LESSON FROM A COUPLE MISTAKES WITH IT.   I HAD BOUGHT BACK IN 2018 AND THEN WATCHED THE STOCK BLEED DOWN TO CLOSE TO HALF MY ORIGINAL INVESTMENT BY MARCH OF 2019.   THIS WAS THE REAL LOW POINT FOR TESLA.   BANKRUPTCY TALK WAS NORMAL AND THE COMPANY WAS BEING EVISCERATED IN THE PRESS.  BUT MY ORIGINAL BELIEF STILL STOOD SO I AVERAGED DOWN PRETTY HEAVILY.   NOW THAT ENDED UP BEING THE RIGHT MOVE THEN FOR SURE.    BUT THE MISTAKE CAME WHEN I THOUGHT I COULD TIME THE MARKET.  

AFTER RIDING OUT ALL THAT AND SEEING A SIGNIFICANT GAIN OF 100% PLUS I STARTED TO GET COCKY.   I THOUGHT  I KNEW BETTER SO I STARTED TO WONDER IF I COULD USE THE VOLATILITY TO ADD MORE TO MY POSITION BY SELLING ON A SPIKE AND BUYING BACK AFTER THE DIP.   WELL I FOUND OUT THAT IT IS MUCH EASIER TO TRY THAT THEN TO ACTUALLY SUCCEED.  I DID THAT TWICE.   THE FIRST TIME I BROKE EVEN.   THE SECOND TIME I LOST 5 SHARES.   NOW THIS WAS PRE SPLIT.   SO IF I JUST HAD HELD TODAY I WOULD HAVE 25 MORE SHARES.   A CURRENT SHARE PRICE THAT IS A $27,000 CAD THAT I PISSED AWAY JUST BECAUSE I WANTED TO BUY A LOTTERY TICKET TO TRY AND GET MORE.   WHAT I DIDN'T REALIZE IS THAT I ALREADY HAD THE WINNING LOTTERY TICKET AND I JUST HAD TO HOLD.   SO THAT BECAME MY NEW STRATEGY.   ON ANY MAJOR DIP I JUST BOUGHT MORE SHARES IF THE FUNDS ALLOWED IT BUT NEVER TOUCHED MY CORE POSITION.   I DECIDED THAT I WOULD ONLY DO THAT IF SOMETHING FUNDAMENTAL CHANGED WITH THE COMPANY OR I HIT WHAT I BELIEVE THE FUTURE SHARE PRICE OF THE COMPANY COULD BE.    THAT STRATEGY HAS PAID OFF EXTREMELY WELL.   

SO EVEN YOUR GREATEST SUCCESSES CAN HAVE ELEMENTS OF FAILURE TOO THEM.  I KNOW NOW THAT MY SUCCESS COULD HAVE EVEN BEEN BETTER IF I HAD JUST STUCK TO MY INITIAL GOAL.   I AM ACTUALLY GLAD I HAD THAT HAPPEN THEN AS IF I HAD SUCCEEDED IT MIGHT HAVE LED TO ME TRYING EVEN MORE AGGRESSIVE MOVES LIKE OPTIONS AND OTHER THINGS THAT COULD HAVE RESULTED AN EVEN GREATER LOSS IN FUTURE GAINS BECAUSE OF A MISTAKE.

726,Jessev1234,CanadianInvestor,"LOVE THE DIALOGUE! I'M ABOUT TO WRITE ANOTHER NOVEL, I HOPE YOU'RE READY. 

YOU'RE MAKING ME THINK IN TERMS OF GOOD OLD FASHIONED FUNDAMENTALS AND THAT NEVER HURTS LOL. I'M GOING TO ADDRESS ALL OF YOUR POINTS BUT THE MAIN THING THAT'S REALLY REALLY HARD TO WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND IS THE 'FANBOYS' LIKE ME. I UNDERSTAND ELON MUSK'S GOALS, I UNDERSTAND HIS GRAND VISION AND THAT TESLA IS MERELY A STEPPING STONE TOWARDS SAVING EARTH AND THE HUMAN SPECIES. WE ALL THINK OF 'THE FUTURE' AND WE PICTURE ELECTRIC CARS AND REUSABLE ROCKET SHIPS AND SELF-DRIVING CARS IN A MILES-DEEP NETWORK OF UNDERGROUND TUNNELS AND GOD DAMN COMPUTERS IN OUR BRAINS, BUT ONLY ONE MAN SEEMS TO KNOW HOW TO GET US THERE. I GET THAT THAT SOUNDS BATSHIT INSANE BUT IT IS WHAT IT IS. I LITERALLY GO TO WORK TO BUY TSLA. I DON'T HAVE TO ANYMORE, BUT IF I DIDN'T, I'D HAVE TO SELL MY TSLA. I WILL USE THE GAINS FROM MY TSLA TO BUY... A TESLA. WHEN I FINALLY RETIRE I'M GOING TO SELL THIS HOUSE, MOVE OUT OF TOWN A BIT, BUILD ANOTHER ONE WITH A TESLA POWERWALL AND A TESLA SOLAR ROOF AND A TESLA HVAC SYSTEM SHITPOSTING ON REDDIT VIA MY STARLINK INTERNET SERVICE. WHEN I'M AT HOME DOING NOTHING AND ELECTRICITY IS IN DEMAND THE TESLA AUTOBIDDER SOFTWARE WILL TELL MY TESLA CYBERTRUCK AND POWERWALL TO SELL POWER BACK TO THE GRID, GENERATING ME AN INCOME FROM SUNLIGHT, JUST LIKE THE SMALL FLEET OF ROBOTAXIS MODEL 3'S I HAVE RUNNING AROUND MAKING ME $30K/YEAR EACH AND DOING THE SAME THING WITH ELECTRICITY ARBITRAGE. PEOPLE CAN TALK SHIT AND DOUBT THIS VISION ALL THEY WANT, THEY KEEP MOVING THE GOALPOSTS AND ELON MUSK KEEPS SILENTLY EXECUTING AND MARCHING TOWARDS THE INEVITABLE. EVERY TOP ENGINEERING GRADUATE WANTS TO WORK FOR TWO COMPANIES, SPACEX OR TESLA. I WANT MY OWN EFFORTS TO GO TOWARDS THAT TOO, THAT MEANS BUYING SHARES AND NEVER SELLING THEM. THE STOCK IS WORTH WHATEVER PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO PAYING FOR IT AND THERE'S MILLIONS LIKE ME THAT JUST WANT AS MANY AS WE CAN GET AT ANY PRICE BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT IT WILL BE ONE DAY. SO WE'RE KINDA COMING FROM TWO OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE SPECTRUM HERE LMFAO.

MAN I SAID I'D ANSWER ALL YOUR POINTS BUT AFTER THAT RANT WHAT'S THE POINT HAHAHA. YOU'RE LOOKING AT IS AS A CAR COMPANY. I KNOW IT'S A MEME AND ALL... BUT TESLA IS NOT A CAR COMPANY. IT IS A COLLECTION OF STARTUPS THAT HAPPENS TO INCLUDE ONE INCREDIBLY VERTICALLY INTEGRATED EV MANUFACTURER THAT ALMOST ACCOUNTS FOR THE PRESENT VALUATION ALL BY ITSELF, LIKE IF GOOD FRENCH FRY SALES IS ALL THAT MCDONALD'S NEEDED TO BE PROFITABLE - THAT DOESN'T MAKE IT A FRENCH FRY COMPANY. ALL OF THESE PRODUCTS/SOLUTIONS THEY PRODUCE WILL WORK SEAMLESSLY TOGETHER. IT'S A BIT LIKE APPLE IN A WAY.. I CAN'T BELIEVE I'M SAYING THAT!... BUT YOU GOTTA ADMIT THE APPLE EXPERIENCE IS PRETTY GOOD IF YOU'RE ALL IN. THE DIFFERENCE IS ELON MUSK, HE'S THE RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD BECAUSE HE DOESN'T CARE WHETHER OR NOT HE'S THE RICHEST MAN IN THE WORLD, HE'S RISKED EVERYTHING HE HAS TO DO WHAT IS NECESSARY TO ACHIEVING HIS GOAL OF PRESERVING LIFE ON EARTH WHILE ALSO GETTING LIFE OFF OF EARTH. WOULD YOU FUCKING LISTEN TO ME?! DUDE I HEAR IT TOO, BUT THE RESULTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES AND IT'S NOT SLOWING DOWN ANYTIME SOON, MARK MY WORDS.

I KEEP GOING BACK AND READING YOUR NUMBERS AND I JUST CAN'T. THERE'S SO MANY THINGS THE AVERAGE PERSON ISN'T AWARE OF THAT I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN. AND IT'S NOT A P/E OF 536 IT'S 1634:1!!! UNLESS YOU'RE USING OTHER NUMBERS? BUT THAT'S EXPONENTIAL GROWTH FORESEEN TO HAPPEN FOR DECADES. IT WILL DOUBLE AND DOUBLE AND DOUBLE. 1600 BECOME 800, 400, 200... AND YA THE STOCK PRICE WILL PROBABLY OUTPACE IT HAHA WHO KNOWS? I DON'T THINK I'M GOING TO WIN YOU OVER WITH NUMBERS, BUT I WOULD BE WILLING TO PUT OUR HEADS TOGETHER ON A SPREADSHEET TO TRY IT. I DON'T KNOW WHERE TO BEGIN VALUING ALL THE THINGS I MENTIONED ABOVE BUT IT WOULD BE FUN TO TRY. THE FIRST STEP IS BELIEVING IT'S ALL POSSIBLE. I WORK FOR A MULTI-BILLION DOLLAR, FORTUNE 200 COMPANY AND I HAD A FUCKING 4-HOUR LONG MEETING TODAY WHERE I WAS IN A ZOOM CALL LEARNING HOW TO ASK OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS INSTEAD OF ONES THAT COULD BE ANSWERED WITH A 'NO'. I HAD BREAK-OUT SESSIONS WHERE WE WORKED AS A TEAM AND IT WAS HORRIBLE. WE PRODUCED ABSOLUTELY NOTHING OF VALUE. IN AN EARLIER CALL TODAY WE DISCUSSED HOW OUR TEAM HAS GROWN TO A SIZE WHERE YOU SHOULDN'T USE THE GOD DAMN REPLY ALL BUTTON TO SAY THANK YOU BECAUSE IT'S SO FUCKING ANNOYING, KAREN. THIS COMPANY HAS TAKEN 10 MONTHS TO REALIZE THAT I'M NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GO TO PALM SPRINGS NEXT MONTH BECAUSE OF A PANDEMIC THAT THEY'VE CHOSEN TO MAKE ABSOLUTELY NO CONTINGENCY PLAN FOR AND NOW THEY RISK LOSING $3M IN RECURRING REVENUE THAT THEY NEED BECAUSE OF THAT SHORT-SIGHTED, QUARTERLY THINKING. ABSOLUTELY BASIC DECISION MAKING SKILLS, COMMON SENSE MANAGEMENT... IT DOESN'T EXIST IN THESE BIG CORPORATIONS. IT'S ABSOLUTELY PATHETIC HOW LOW MY EXPECTATIONS ARE FOR LITERALLY ANYTHING, AND IF YOU DIRECT MESSAGE ME I'LL TELL YOU THE STOCK TICKER WE TRADE UNDER... IT'S A VERY HIGHLY REGARDED, 100+YEAR-OLD, DIVIDEND-PAYING, S&AMP;P 500 COMPANY WHOSE PRODUCTS YOU USE EVERY DAY WITHOUT EVEN KNOWING IT. THIS IS THE COMPETITION. BMW, FORD, GM, ALL OF THEM, THEY'RE NOT GOING TO SURVIVE. A CEO IS THERE TO MAKE HIS MARK WITHOUT TAKING ANY CHANCES, CAN'T ROCK THE BOAT, CAUSE THE STOCK TO DIP BECAUSE SOMETHING DIDN'T WORK, JUST SHUT UP, STICK TO THE STATUS QUO AND COLLECT A NICE SEVERANCE PACKAGE AND A PENSION. WHY, AND HOW, DO YOU TAKE 100 YEARS OF THINKING THAT WAY AND FLIP IT ON ITS HEAD? YOU DON'T, THEY WILL SIMPLY FADE AWAY INTO NOTHING. WHEN SOMETHING ISN'T WORKING AT SPACEX OR TESLA, THEY RECOGNIZE IT AND TRY SOMETHING ELSE. THE BFG/STARSHIP SWITCHING FROM CARBON FIBER COMPOSITE TO STAINLESS STEEL IS THE MOST ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE EXAMPLE OF THIS, BUT THAT'S A WHOLE 'NOTHER TOPIC. AND THEN TO USE THAT STEEL ON THE CYBERTRUCK... WHO DOES THAT?! THE GREATEST MIND OF OUR GENERATION WITH ACCESS TO THE WORLD'S BEST AND MOST MOTIVATED ENGINEERS IN EVERY FIELD. SANDY MUNRO, I HOPE YOU KNOW WHO I'M TALKING ABOUT, FOUND LIKE 13 DESIGN CHANGES BETWEEN MODEL Y OCTOVALVES BUILT A FEW WEEKS APART. IT REALLY ALL COMES DOWN TO THAT WILLINGNESS TO FAIL QUICKLY, ITERATE, AND NEVER STOPPING LEARNING AND IMPROVING.

YES! I'VE GENUINELY BEEN THINKING ABOUT YOU/THIS ALL DAY. THANKS AGAIN. I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO READ A THING AND WATCH A THING, BECAUSE THEY DO A GREAT JOB OF SUMMARIZING WHAT WOULD TAKE ME PAGES TO WRITE, AND THEY COME WITH PRETTY PICTURES.


SO FIRST, ARK IN JANUARY 2020 BEFORE THE HUGE RUN AND CAPITAL RAISES THAT ONLY ACCELERATE GROWTH: HTTPS://ARK-INVEST.COM/ARTICLES/ANALYST-RESEARCH/TESLA-PRICE-TARGET/


TESLA DAILY - WATCH FROM ABOUT 3:00 TO 30:00: HTTPS://WWW.YOUTUBE.COM/WATCH?V=Z6SVUTG9Z3G&AMP;T=232S


I DID SOME QUICK MATH... VERY QUICK... WHERE I CALCULATED MARKET CAP AT END OF 2021 BUT I EXCLUDED CAPEX. TO ME, I WANT TESLA REINVESTING INTO AS MANY FACTORIES AND SUPERCHARGERS AS POSSIBLE NOW, BECAUSE THEY ARE MONEY PRINTERS IN THE FUTURE. WITH SOME COLLABORATION AND MORE WORK I COULD DO MUCH BETTER BUT I'M NOT AN ANALYST AND DON'T HAVE THE DATA I'D NEED IN FRONT OF ME.


BASICALLY, I BELIEVE TESLA WILL PRODUCE 500,000 VEHICLES IN SHANGHAI NEXT YEAR, 500,000 IN FREMONT, AND 250,000 IN BERLIN. THESE ARE NICE ROUND NUMBERS, SHANGHAI AND FREMONT COULD BE HIGHER, BERLIN LOWER, ETC. I THINK THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE THAT MODEL Y PRODUCTION STARTS UP IN AUSTIN AS WELL, BUT NOT COUNTING ON IT. SO LET'S GO WITH 1,250,000. THIS IS ABOVE MOST PREDICTIONS, BUT TO ME IS SIMPLE MATH. I COULD EASILY GET OFF IN THE WEEDS ON SO MANY TOPICS SO I'M JUST GOING TO MAKE MY STATEMENTS AND YOU CHALLENGE THE ONES YOU WANT TO CHALLENGE. 1.25M VEHICLES.


AT AN AVERAGE REVENUE PER VEHICLE OF $50,000 (SAW THIS RECENTLY, I BELIEVE IT'S ACCURATE) AND A PROFIT MARGIN OF 30% (I BELIEVE THIS IS THE CURRENT PM OF THE NEW SHANGHAI MODEL Y LINE, OTHERS ARE LOWER, BUT NEW LINES WILL BE EVEN HIGHER, UP TO 40%) THAT GIVES US; 1,250,000 X 50,000 X 0.3 = $18.75B PROFIT ON VEHICLE SALES ALONE. THIS IS 2021, VEHICLES PRODUCED WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE AT ROUGHLY 50% YOY AFTER 2021 AND PROFIT MARGIN WILL CLIMB.


AUTONOMY. IN MY ESTIMATES I'M NOT CALLING AUTONOMY SOLVED, BUT THEY ARE GETTING PAID FOR IT. WHEN IT'S ACTUALLY DONE THROW ALL OF THIS OUT THE WINDOW, IF YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT ROBOTAXIS GO WATCH AUTONOMY DAY FROM 1:09:00 ON: HTTPS://YOUTU.BE/UCP0TTMVQOE

SO WHILE IT'S VERY CLOSE TODAY (SEE HTTPS://WWW.YOUTUBE.COM/C/JAMESLOCKE/VIDEOS) IT'S NOT DONE. RIGHT NOW FSD COSTS $10K. ELON HAS SAID OVER AND OVER THAT THE MORE COMPLETE IT IS, THE MORE EXPENSIVE IT WILL BE. I BELIEVE IN THE FUTURE YOU'LL PAY PER MILE, PER MONTH, SOMETHING, BUT TODAY IT IS 10K. I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE PURCHASE IT OUTRIGHT, LET'S BE CONSERVATIVE AND SAY... 25%? REMEMBER EVERY SINGLE SALE OF FSD IS PURE PROFIT. THE HARDWARE IS PAID FOR, THE R&AMP;D HAPPENS REGARDLESS, EVERY SALE GOES RIGHT TO THE BOTTOM LINE. 1,250,000 X 10,000 X 0.25 = $3.125B


WE COULD GET INTO SOLAR, ENERGY ETC, WHICH WILL BE HUGE BUT ARE RATHER INSIGNIFICANT TODAY. SO IN 2021 THAT'S ROUGHLY $22B PROFIT ON VEHICLES ALONE. IF WE GIVE IT A FAIRLY NORMAL (I THINK?) GROWTH STOCK P:E OF 25:1 THAT'S A MARKET CAP OF $550B. THAT'S 'UNDERVALUED' COMPARED TO WHERE THE STOCK IS AT BUT I'M LEAVING SO MANY THINGS OUT. REFER TO THE ARK PAGE TO SEE WHAT A DIFFERENCE AUTONOMY MAKES; IT'S EITHER WORTH $4000 OR $15,000, THERE'S NO IN-BETWEEN. COSTS WILL CONTINUE TO DROP AS FACTORIES ARE COMPLETED, PRODUCTION OPTIMIZED, PRODUCT SIMPLIFIED, VEHICLES BUILT CLOSER TO CUSTOMERS REDUCING SHIPPING AND INVENTORY, ETC ETC. NEVERMIND THAT THE FLOAT IS EVER-SHRINKING, PEOPLE WANT THIS STOCK. I WANT TO BUY ALL THAT I CAN AND HOLD ON TO IT FOR AS LONG AS POSSIBLE. I COULD TAKE HUGE PROFITS NOW BUT THE FUTURE POTENTIAL IS TOO ENTICING, I'LL KEEP WORKING TO PUT TSLA SHARES ON THE TABLE.


I FEEL LIKE IF I WRITE ANY MORE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO READ IT LOL SO I'M GOING TO STOP THERE AND SEE WHAT YOU HAVE TO SAY SO FAR. REMEMBER I'M NO EXPERT, JUST YOUR AVERAGE INVESTOR THAT'S BEEN FOLLOWING THIS THING FOR A LONG TIME AND TRYING TO POKE HOLES IN IT, I DON'T SEE ANY.

741,Erland_Brynjar,CanadianInvestor,"QQQ HAS A 15-YEAR TRAILING-RETURN OF 15% AND $10 000 WOULD HAVE GROWN TO $84 585.03

AT THIS SAME TIME LAST YEAR THAT NUMBER WAS $58 546.85 AND IN 2019 AT THIS TIME IT WAS $44 594.20.

LOOKING AT ITOT AGAIN, RIGHT NOW IT IS $40 647.09. AT THIS SAME TIME IN 2019 IT WAS $33 068.36.


WHAT THIS SAYS TO ME IS THAT THE NASDAQ IS HAVING AN AWESOME BULL RUN MORE THAN THE STOCK MARKET AS A WHOLE. WILL THIS CONTINUE? WHO KNOWS, WILL QQQ PROBABLY GO FINE OR BETTER - ALMOST CERTAINLY.


THE REAL ‚ÄúPROBLEM WITH QQQ IS IT WILL BE MORE VOLATILE - IF YOU CAN HANDLE THAT IT SHOULD SERVE YOU WELL. I THINK MANY ARE STILL SCARED FROM 2000 BECAUSE IT TOOK TILL 2015 TO GET YOUR MONEY BACK TO $10000 IF YOU INVESTED THEN.


TEC IS JUST QQQ WITH A TILT TO UP AND COMING DISRUPTIVE COMPANIES. MER WILL COST YOU MAYBE $1000 OVER 15 YEARS WITH $10K INVESTED. I THINK IT IS GREAT AS A TILT BUT YOU DECIDE YOUR OWN RISK TOLERANCE.


ARKK IS A BET ON WOODS VALUATION OF TSLA AND THAT SHE CAN MAINTAIN HER RUN BEYOND TEN YEARS (WHICH HAS A LOW PROBABILITY BUT IS TOTALLY POSSIBLE). IT IS MUCH HIGHER RISK, WHICH HAS THE POTENTIAL FIR MUCH HIGHER RETURNS.


THE REAL ‚ÄúPROBLEM‚Äù WITH ARKK IS THAT MOST INVESTORS WON‚ÄôT SEE THE RETURNS POSTED ON MORNINGSTAR BECAUSE THEY WILL BUY HIGH AND SELL AFTER THE FIRST BIG CORRECTION. IF YOU GO ARKK AND WANT TO WIN, YOU HAVE TO BE A TRUE BELIEVER AND LEAVE YOUR MONEY IN WHEN EVERYONE ELSE IS DUMPING IT (AND AT SOME POINT IT WILL DUMP - HOPEFULLY TEMPORARILY). IT WILL EITHER HIT A BOTTOM AND REBOUND, OR IT WON‚ÄôT. IF YOU SELL ON THE WAY DOWN AND PLANNING TO BUY BACK IN YOU‚ÄôLL MISS THE BOTTOM AND LEAVE MOST OF YOUR RETURNS ON THE TABLE.


THE BEST FUND MANAGER IN THE 80-90S MADE 20% RETURNS ON AVERAGE EACH YEAR, HIS INVESTORS MADE -10% ON AVERAGE BECAUSE HE DIPPED 9 TIMES, ALWAYS MORE THAN THE MARKET, AND THEY SOLD OFF THINKING HE WAS DOWN AND OUT AND MISSED HIS METEORITIC RISE BACK.

THE ONLY STOCK IN THE ARK PORFOLIO THAT I HAVE MIXED OPINIONS IS TESLA. UNLIKE SOME OF THE OTHER COMPANIES REFERENCED IN THE ARTICLE THAT EITHER HAS A BUSINESS THAT ACTUALLY DIDN'T PAN OUT OR BLEW UP DUE TO COOKING THE BOOKS, I SINCERLY DO THINK TESLA IS A GOOD COMPANY RUN BY A GOOD CEO. I THINK TESLA AS A COMPANY HAS MATURED OVER COME THE PRODUCTION HELL OF THE MODEL 3. I THINK THEY PRODUCE THE BEST EV CARS AND EV ARE ONLY GONNA KEEP BECOMING MORE COMMON OVER GAS CARS. 

HOWEVER, I CAN'T HELP BUT TO FEEL THAT TSLA IS ALSO OVER INFLATED DUE TO THE HYPE. IT'S HARD TO HAVE SENSIBLE DISCUSSION WITH TSLA HOLDERS WITHOUT THEM TURNING TOWARDS INSULTS AND SUGGESTIONS THAT I EITHER SELL OR SHORT THE STOCK. THE P/E IS JUST GROWING TO THE POINT OF BEING COMICAL. SURE YOU CAN USE FORWARD P/E TO EXPLAIN THAT THE PRICE WILL BE 10X BY 2024 UP FROM 400. IT'S A BIT AHEAD OF SCHEDULE DUE TO THE HYPE, BUT IT FEELS LIKE I'M BUYING A HOUSE TODAY FOR THE PRICE OF WHAT IT WILL BE LIKE 2024, WHICH MAKES NO SENSE. AND HERE'S THE KICKER, PEOPLE ARE ALSO INTERNALIZING TODAY'S AHEAD OF SCHEDULE PRICE APPRECIATION AND THEN USE THE SAME EXPLAIN OF 10X BY 2024. SO BASICALLY THE STATEMENT THAT IT WILL 10X BY 2024 FROM 15ISH MONTHS AGO IS NOW 100X.

THAT IS WHY AN ARISTOCRAT DIVIDEND STOCK WILL ALMOST NEVER PUMP LIKE A TSLA, THEY ARE SACRIFICING FUTURE EARNINGS BY PAYING DIVIDEND RATHER THAN REINVESTING. THEIR PRICE MOVEMENT REFLECTS THIS, OVER TIME.

ANYWAYS YEAH, CATHIE IS TRULY A VISIONARY IMO. SHE PREDICTED THE RISE OF TSLA BACK A COUPLE YEARS AGO AND THE GROWTH OF MANY SMALLER COMPANIES WHICH AT THE TIME, SHE WAS BEING RIDICULED AND LAUGHED AT AGAIN AND AGAIN. I GUESS NOW PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO TRUST HER AND FLOCK INTO IT REALLY FAST.

THO, I'D ADVISE YOU TO BE CAREFUL AND DCA AND ESPECIALLY BUY THE DIPS. WE MAY SEE A CORRECTION NEXT YEAR AND MANY INVESTORS WHO BOUGHT AT THE TOP WILL SELL OUT LEAVING ARK TO SELL PARTS OF THEIR POSITION, AND WITH SOME OF THE COMPANIES SHE OWNS, THIS SORT OF SELL OFF CAN LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT DECLINES. YOU GOTTA STAY FOCUSED AND UNEMOTIONAL IN THOSE TIMES.

I'D ALSO SUGGEST OFTEN REVISING HER OUTLOOK ON THE CURRENT SITUATIONS AND THEIR THESIS. WOULD YOU STILL AGREE WITH IT? DO YOU THINK SHE'S GOTTEN OUT OF TOUCH WITH REALITY? HEY, MAYBE IT COULD SEEM THIS WAY, BUT SHE'S JUST TOO MUCH OF A GENIUS THAT SHE JUST KNOWS WHERE SHE'S HEADED RIGHT? BUT IT'S ALSO POSSIBLE THAT SHE COULD LOSE HER TOUCH AFTER SOME YEARS.

I LIKE CATHIE WOOD AND I LIKE ARK, BUT THEY PROBABLY WON'T HAVE ANOTHER 100% YEAR. I THINK CATHIE SAID THEY AIM FOR 30% AVERAGE ANNUAL RETURN FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS (WHICH IS AMAZING IF THEY CAN PULL IT OFF).

PETER LYNCH HAD A TWELVE YEAR STRETCH OF 30% ANNUAL RETURNS, BUT MOST OF THE INVESTORS IN HIS FUND ONLY GOT 7%. WHY? BECAUSE A LOT OF THEM BOUGHT WHEN THE FUND PERFORMED WELL, AND SOLD WHEN IT UNDERPERFORMED. I THINK THAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO ARK INVESTORS TOO.

THAT IS TO SAY, IF YOU CHOOSE TO PUT MONEY INTO ARKK THEN PLAN TO KEEP HOLDING AND ADDING FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AT LEAST. DON'T  GET SCARED AND SELL WHEN THE FUND GOES DOWN 20% ONE YEAR.

THIS IS INSANITY, ALTHOUGH THE COMMON RHETORIC AT THE MOMENT.

&AMP;#X200B;

MANY GREAT EXAMPLES EXPLAINING WHY THIS IS INSANITY. MANY DOT COM SURVIVORS, GOOD COMPANIES, JUST NOW REACHING YEAR 2000 LEVELS (E.G. CISCO). 20 YEARS LATER. 

&AMP;#X200B;

TSLA WOULD NEED TO TAKE OVER THE ENTIRETY OF THE VEHICLE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY TO GROW INTO ITS CURRENT VALUATION. EVEN IF YOU BELIEVE THE TSLA STORY, THAT'D TAKE 20 YEARS. 

&AMP;#X200B;

ETC. ETC. ETC. 

&AMP;#X200B;

OF COURSE VALUATION MATTERS. A GOOD COMPANY DOESN'T MEAN IT'S A GOOD STOCK TO BUY.  WHEN BUYING A STOCK, YOU'RE BUYING A PIECE OF THE BUSINESS. YOU NEED TO EXPECT A REASONABLE RETURN ON THIS PURCHASE. IF I WERE TO OFFER YOU AMAZON STOCK FOR $1,000,000/SHARE, WOULD THAT MAKE SENSE? WOULD THE VALUATION NOT MATTER BECAUSE IT'S A GOOD COMPANY THAT HAS EXPECTED GROWTH? HOW ABOUT $10,000,000/SHARE? $100,000,000? OF COURSE THAT'S LUDICROUS. THE VALUATION ALWAYS MATTERS. THERE IS A POINT THERE, WELL BEFORE $1M/SHARE WHERE IT BECOMES RIDICULOUS TO BUY INTO AMZN, REGARDLESS OF HOW ""GOOD"" YOU THINK THE COMPANY IS.
