WHEN BEZOS AND MUSK SOLD THEIR STOCK, I SOLD MINE TOO. I SOLD AMZN FOR $3530 AND TSLA FOR $1180, SO I'M SELLING HIGH. AT THAT TIME MY ACCOUNT INCREASED BY 120K PROFIT.  
AFTER THAT, I STARTED SHORTING, I KEPT SHORTING TSLA AND AMZN, WHICH BROUGHT ME OVER 250K IN PROFIT (INCLUDING 120K IN GOLD I BOUGHT HERE).  
ONE BACK AND FORTH AND I'VE MADE 390K. BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE JUST WATCH THEIR PROFITS INCREASE AS THE STOCK MARKET GOES UP AND THEN DISAPPEAR WHEN THE STOCK MARKET GOES DOWN.  
  
ALSO, I THINK A DIVERSIFIED INVESTMENT STRATEGY SHOULD BE PRACTICED, WHICH IS THE GREATEST INVESTMENT STRATEGY OF THE 20TH CENTURY. FROM A LONG-TERM INVESTMENT PERSPECTIVE, THE BEST DIVERSIFICATION STRATEGIES ARE COMPREHENSIVE, INCLUDING DIVERSIFICATION AGAINST INFLATION, FINANCIAL CRISES, AND SOCIAL UNREST.  
WE CAN SELECTIVELY INVEST 40%-60% OF OUR CASH IN THE STOCK MARKET. IN THE STOCK MARKET, WE STILL FOLLOW A DIVERSIFIED INVESTMENT STRATEGY. INCLUDING TECHNOLOGY STOCKS, ENERGY STOCKS, CONSUMER STOCKS, FINANCIAL STOCKS, MEDICAL STOCKS AND EVEN INDICES, ETC., YOU CAN REFER TO MSFT/AAPL/CO/TSLA/XOM, ETC.;  
  
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN INVESTING NOW.  
AT PRESENT, DOMESTIC INFLATION IS VERY SERIOUS AND HAS EXCEEDED THE HIGHEST VALUE IN 40 YEARS. SOME FED OFFICIALS SAID A RATE HIKE WAS IMMINENT. THAT MEANS THE STOCK MARKET COULD FALL SHARPLY. AND, HISTORICALLY, FINANCIAL MARKETS HAVE HAD A FINANCIAL CRISIS EVERY 10 TO 20 YEARS. THE CURRENT SITUATION IS HIGH PRICES, HIGH HOUSING PRICES, HIGH INFLATION, AND HIGH DEBT. THE BASIC CONDITIONS FOR THE FINANCIAL CRISIS ARE ALREADY IN PLACE.  
SO, NOW IS DEFINITELY NOT THE BEST TIME TO INVEST.",hyqdp5y,t3_t2sh4x,1646018651,1646043851.0,/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/t2sh4x/31_starting_a_family_started_investing_during_the/hyqdp5y/

17,Azkatchy,CanadianInvestor,"I DIDN'T KNOW THERE WAS A CAD-HEDGED VERSION OF TSLA. COULD YOU TELL ME WHAT TICKER SYMBOL IT IS?

&AMP;#X200B;

ALSO I WOULD SAY THAT THE MAIN ADVANTAGE OF HAVING A CAD-HEDGED VERSION WOULD BE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE AVOIDING CONVERSION FEES. IF YOU'RE WITH WEALTHSIMPLE TRADE, YOU WILL PAY A 1,5% SPREAD FEE ON TOP OF THE CURRENT EXCHANGE RATE OF CAD/USD AND UPON THE RESALE, YOU WILL ALSO PAY ANOTHER 1,5% WHICH CAN ADD UP TO A LOT.

IF YOU USE QUESTRADE, IT IS A 2% SPREAD FEE. THAT BEING SAID, QUESTRADE ALLOWS FOR THE NORBERT GAMBIT METHOD THAT COMPLETELY ELIMINATES THE SPREAD FEE (YOU CAN DO SOME RESEARCH ON THAT METHOD IF YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH IT).

&AMP;#X200B;

THE SECOND ADVANTAGE IS THAT YOU ARE NOT VULNERABLE TO THE FLUCTUATION IN THE US DOLLAR'S VALUE RELATIVE TO THE CAD DOLLAR'S VALUE.

IF YOU BUY THE CAD-HEDGED VERSION OF TSLA, A DROP IN THE US DOLLAR'S VALUE RELATIVE TO THE CAD DOLLAR'S VALUE WOULD NOT AFFECT YOUR GAINS WHATSOEVER.

THAT BEING SAID, IF YOU HAD BOUGHT A REGULAR TSLA SHARE AND THE USD WENT UP IN VALUE RELATIVE TO THE CAD, THEN YOU WOULD TECHNICALLY HAVE MADE MORE MONEY BECAUSE YOUR TSLA SHARES ARE IN USD AND BY HOLDING THEM, YOU INDIRECTLY HOLD USD WHICH WOULD BE WORTH MORE THAN CAD DOLLARS.",hx29udg,t3_st5pl3,1644947927,1644973127.0,/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/st5pl3/cad_hedged_stocks/hx29udg/

60,gcko,CanadianInvestor,"I BUY WHEN EVERYONE IS AFRAID, WAIT FOR SELL OFFS TO HAPPEN THEN BUY WHEN I THINK I’M GETTING A GOOD DEAL OR THE STOCK IS OVERSOLD. I USUALLY STICK TO GOOD COMPANIES OR ONES WITH LARGE MARKET CAPS. LET ME GIVE YOU A FEW RECENT EXAMPLES FROM LAST YEAR. 

I BOUGHT AAPL WHEN THE SAME THING WAS HAPPENING EARLIER IN 2021 (BIG MONEY ROTATING OUT OF TECH). ALMOST BOUGHT TSLA TOO WHEN BURRY CAME OUT THAT HE WAS SHORTING IT BUT IT NEVER HIT MY $500 TARGET ENTRY. ALMOST THOUGH.

I BOUGHT SU AND TD WHEN DELTA (COVID) WAS MAKING PEOPLE AFRAID OF FURTHER LOCKDOWNS AFTER THEY HAD A NICE LITTLE RUN EARLIER IN 2021 FOR THE SAME REASONS AS THEY DO NOW. FIGURED THEY’D POP RIGHT BACK UP AND THEY DID. 

I BUY BTC WHEN CHINA BANS IT. (YES THEY’VE DONE IT MORE THAN A FEW TIMES NOW)

SOMETIMES THE MARKET CORRECTS ITSELF ALMOST OVERNIGHT OR SOMETIMES IT TAKES A YEAR FOR SECTOR ROTATIONS TO REVERSE. EITHER WAY I BUY STOCKS I DON’T MIND HAVING IN MY PORTFOLIO LONG TERM AND JUST KEEP BUYING IF IT GOES LOWER. 

I DON’T REALLY WAIT ON THE SIDELINES FOR AN ENTRY. I’LL SOMETIMES KEEP ~5% CASH IN MY PORTFOLIO IF I JUST CLOSED A POSITION IN ORDER TO DO THIS BUT THE REST JUST GOES INTO MY ETFS IF NOTHING SEEMS INTERESTING THAT WEEK. I DON’T TRY TO MESS AROUND BY SELLING OR TIMING THESE. JUST BUY AND HOLD. IF A STOCK OR SECTOR IS GETTING BEATEN AND I THINK IT’S OVERSOLD OR PEOPLE ARE OVERREACTING THEN I’LL START USING MY BI-WEEKLY DEPOSITS TO BUY THAT, THEN EVENTUALLY ROLL MOST OF THE PROFITS INTO ETFS AND I EITHER KEEP THE REST OF THE POSITION OR EXIT COMPLETELY AND WAIT FOR FEAR TO COME BACK. RINSE AND REPEAT. 

SOMETIMES IT TAKES A WHILE BUT THAT’S WHY YOU ONLY BUY STUFF ON SALE YOU DON’T MIND HAVING LONG TERM ANYWAYS. 

YOU CAN DO THIS FOR SMALLER CAPS TOO BUT IT’S OBVIOUSLY MUCH RISKIER IN TERMS OF HOLDING THE BAG. CURRENTLY DOING IT WITH NUMI. I’VE ALWAYS BEEN INTERESTED IN THE SECTOR BUT MISSED THE “SHROOM BOOM” SO I JUST WAITED. I FINALLY BOUGHT AT 0.50 JUST BEFORE XMAS PLANNING TO DCA AND IT’S BEEN SWINGING BETWEEN THAT AND 0.70 LATELY SO I’VE BEEN SWING TRADING IT WITH ABOUT 30-50% OF MY POSITION. I NOW HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF SHARES I INITIALLY HAD, BUT MY INITIAL CAPITAL HAS BEEN TAKEN OUT AS PROFITS ALREADY SO I CAN REST EASY EVEN IF I HAVE TO BAG HOLD FOR 5 YEARS KNOWING IT’S JUST MONEY I DIDN’T HAVE SO NOT A BIG DEAL IF IT DISAPPEARS (I ADMIT I GOT LUCKY WITH THIS ONE, THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO TAKE MUCH LONGER BUT YOU GET THE IDEA). 

TIMING THE BOTTOM IS JUST AS HARD AS TIMING THE TOP. JUST WAIT FOR THE KNIFE THE FALL AND FIND SUPPORT. OBVIOUSLY THAT DOESN’T WORK EVERY TIME BUT THE WAY I LOOK AT IT, IS IF AAPL IS SITTING AT A PRICE I WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE THAN HAPPY TO BUY 4-6 MONTHS AGO THEN WHY AM I NOT BUYING NOW?",ht1e93y,t3_s5bdj4,1642428180,1642453380.0,/r/CanadianInvestor/comments/s5bdj4/brookfield_asset_management_bamato/ht1e93y/

70,dolpherx,CanadianInvestor,"WHAT ARE YOU COMPARING IT TO? LIKE EVERYTHING IN TECH IS UP AT LEAST 100% IN 2020-2021. MOST ARE LIKE 200%. LOOK AT APPLE, THE LARGEST COMPANY IN THE WORLD TRIPLED IN 3 YEARS. WHAT OTHER COMPANY IN THE WORLD CAN MATCH APPLE'S LOW RISK PROFILE? YOUR SMALL CAP OIL, YOU ARE TAKING SUCH A BIG RISK AFTER YEARS OF LOSSES, AND YOU ONLY GET 300%? DAMN, EVEN TSLA RETURNED 740% IN 2020, 30% IN 2021....AND LIKE ITS ONE OF THE MOST BOUGHT STOCKS ON THE STOCK MARKET. FOR THAT LEVEL OF RISK, I WANT A 10X EFFECT. HECK WHEN I INVESTED IN CANADIAN WEED, MY RETURNS WERE 1000%. THIS IS WHAT I EXPECT FOR THE HIGHER LEVEL OF RISK, IF THE REWARD IS LOWER, WHY NOT JUST INVEST IN SOMETHING SAFER THEN AND THE REWARD IS THE SAME.

&AMP;#X200B;

THIS IS WHAT MOST CANADIANS ARE MISSING. THEY GO TO THE BANK AND THEIR BANK TELLS THEM THEY MAKE 16% THIS YEAR, AND THEY ARE HAPPY. YOU CAN;T JUST WALK OUT HAPPY WITHOUT KNOWING THE RISK AND REWARDS AND COMPARING IT WITH BENCHMARKS. IF S&AMP;P500 DID 28%, 16% IS TERRIBLE. I AM SORT OF IN THE FINANCE WORLD, AND IT MAKES ME WANT TO CLAW A CHALKBOARD EACH TIME I MEET A CANADIAN THAT IS HAPPY WITH THESE KINDS OF RETURNS WITHOUT KNOWING THE REST OF THE MARKET.

YOU MENTIONED SMALL CAPS OIL DID REALLY WELL, WHAT ABOUT THE 5 YEARS BEFORE THAT? JUST LOOK AT APPLE, S&AMP;P500, THESE ARE THE EASIEST COMPARISON. IF YOU CANNOT BEAT THESE CONSISTENTLY, WELL THEN ITS NOT ENOUGH REWARD FOR THE RISKS YOU ARE TAKING. A GOOD INVESTMENT IS NOT JUST GOOD RETURNS, ITS GOOD RETURNS FOR THE RISKS YOU ARE TAKING.

WHILE CANADA HAS GOOD RENEWABLE EQUITIES IN THE “OPERATING ASSETS” SEGMENT, IT DOES NOT PROVIDE YOU THE GROWTH EXPOSURE OF THE MORE TARGETED AND GEOGRAPHICALLY DIVERSIFIED FAN &AMP; TAN TYPE ETFS (NOT RECOMMENDING THESE, BUT STRONGLY RECOMMEND LOOKING THROUGH THEIR HOLDINGS). PBW HAS INTERESTING HOLDINGS (DIFFERENT FROM HCLN/ZCLN), AND TSLA SHOULD ALSO BE UNDER CONSIDERATION AS A PART OF THE ELECTRIFICATION PLAY. I STAY AWAY FROM THE BROAD “CLEAN ENERGY “ ETFS THOUGH AS THEY CAN END UP HOLDING PROBLEM SECTORS LIKE HYDROGEN, BIOMASS, AND OVER-HYPED EV STOCKS OF COMPANIES WITH NO REVENUE. DEFINITELY BEWARE.

YTD IS GENERALLY A BAD METRIC - IF YOU DECIDED TO INVEST IN RENEWABLES I WOULD HOPE YOU ARE HAVING A LONGER TIME HORIZON THAN A FEW QUARTERS. NUMBERS IN THE SECTOR LOOK VERY DIFFERENT IF YOU COMPARED START OF DECADE (JAN 2020) TO DATE (BEFORE PANDEMIC CRASH).
