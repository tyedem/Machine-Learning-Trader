1,johnnychi,CanadianInvestor,"I HAVE BEEN WORRIED IN THE BACK OF MY MIND ABOUT THIS POLITICAL FOOTBALL. I THINK THE HUAWEI ISSUE IS A POLITICAL FOOTBALL AND NOT A NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE. WAS THERE EXPLICIT PROOF ASIDE FROM ""IT'S CHINESE"" AND ""THE CHINESE ARE ALL EVIL SO THEIR COMPANIES MUST BE DOING WHAT EVERY OTHER TECHNOLOGY COMPANY IS LIKELY DOING AS WELL""? (TO MAKE IT SIMPLE INSTEAD OF LISTING THEM SUCH AS INTEL BACKDOORS CISCO ROUTERS, AT&AMP;T SECRET INSTALLATION, ETC. JUST LOOK UP SNOWDEN.)

&AMP;#X200B;

REMEMBER THE ""CHINESE INSTALLED CHIPS THAT CAN BYPASS YOUR PROTECTIONS"" SCAREMONGERING THAT FIZZLED IN A FEW DAYS AFTER BOTH AAPL AND AMZN DEMANDED BLOOMBERG RETRACT THEIR STORY FOR A LACK OF PROOF. EVEN SECURITY EXPERTS DID NOT AGREE WITH THE HIT PIECE. I WAS TAKEN INTO IT, BUT AFTER SEEING THE RESULTING FALLOUT NOW HAVE DOUBTS AND CONTINUE TO THINK WE ARE BEING INFLUENCED FOR SOME GROUPS' POLITICAL GAINS.

/U/JUGWHATEVER GAVE YOU A WHOLE BUNCH OF STOCKS WHICH COULD BE DESCRIBED AS ""GROWTH STOCKS"" (THOUGH I'M AGAINST THE NEEDLESS CATEGORIZATION OF STOCKS). THERE ARE DOZENS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF OTHER COMPANIES WITH LONG TRACK RECORDS OF GROWING REVENUES, EARNINGS, AND THEIR SHARE PRICE. JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T SEE THEM, OR CHOOSE TO CATEGORIZE THEM AS SOMETHING ELSE, DOESN'T MEAN THERE ISN'T ANY GROWTH IN THE CANADIAN MARKETS. 

* THERE ARE LOTS OF MINING STOCKS WHICH ARE NOT PUMP AND DUMPS, REGARDLESS OF YOUR FEELINGS. THEY'RE NOT FOR EVERYONE, BUT THERE ARE MANY SUCH STOCKS GROWING LIKE GANGBUSTERS, WITH REAL ASSETS WHICH SELL REAL GOODS.
* WHERE ARE RETAIL OR CONSUMER STOCKS IN YOUR CLASSIFICATIONS? LOOK AT CANADIAN TIRE, CANADA GOOSE, ALIMENTATION COUCHE-TARD, MTY, ETC.
* WITHOUT THE NEED TO CLASSIFY COMPANIES INTO SECTORS - SJ, CN, CP, BAM.A, IFC, LNR, DRM, MEQ, CAR.UN, PIF, GUD, MRC, IAM, PLC, GSY, BUS, MG, DAP.U, PBL, ETC. SOME OF THESE YOU MIGHT DISMISS AS ""VALUE"" OR ""DIVIDEND GROWTH"" BUT IF THEY'VE BEEN GROWING EARNINGS AT 10+% A YEAR, IT'S RIDICULOUS TO DISMISS THEM AS NOT ""GROWTH"" STOCKS.

IN YOUR REPLY TO /U/JUGWHATEVER, YOU SAY: 

&GT;  I AGREE THAT THERE IS CERTAINLY GROWTH TO BE HAD IN CANADA, BUT IT'S  NOTHING LIKE THE US. I LOOKED AT SOME OF THE COMPANIES YOU LISTED, AND  OVERALL NOT TOO IMPRESSED COMPARED TO U.S GROWTH. 

TALK ABOUT MOVING THE GOAL POSTS. ""OKAY FINE, THERE IS GROWTH IN CANADIAN STOCKS, BUT NOT AS MUCH AS IN THE US!"" SURE, NOBODY HERE WILL ARGUE THAT. BUT YOU REALIZE THE POPULATION OF THE POPULATION OF THE US IS 10X OF CANADA'S? WHY WOULD WE HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF GROWTH STOCKS AS THEM?  

AND SECOND, HOW MUCH OF THE US' GROWTH ARE YOU ATTRIBUTING TO A FEW OUTLIERS? WHEN THE US MARKET IS PREDOMINANTLY AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, AND MSFT, AND THEY'VE HAD A LOT OF STOCKS GROW WELL PAST THEIR INTRINSIC VALUE (NFLX, TSLA, ETC), OBVIOUSLY THE US WILL LOOK LIKE IT HAS GREATER GROWTH.  

IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU'VE FALLEN VICTIM TO THE AVAILABILITY HEURISTIC. US STOCKS ARE COVERED MORE IN THE MEDIA, ON REDDIT, IN FORUMS, ETC MAKING THEIR GROWTH STOCKS VERY EASY TO RECALL. IT IS EASIER TO MAKE AN ERRONEOUS BLANKET STATEMENT LIKE ""YOU CAN'T BE A GROWTH INVESTOR IN CANADIAN STOCKS"" THAN IT IS TO SPEND HOURS RESEARCHING POLLARD BANKNOTE OR XPEL TECHNOLOGIES. WHEN STOCKS HAVE GROWN A LOT BUT ARE STILL CHEAP (LINAMAR, MAGNA, MORGUARD) IT IS EASY TO SAY ""NAH, THOSE ARE VALUE STOCKS - WHO CARES IF THEY'VE GROWN A LOT - THE P/E IS 6X!"" 

THE BIGGEST AND EASIEST STOCKS TO THINK OF IN THE US CAN REASONABLY BE CALLED ""GROWTH STOCKS"", WHEREAS THE BIGGEST AND EASIEST STOCKS TO THINK OF IN CANADA ARE BANKS, FORTIS, BCE, ETC, WHAT YOU'VE DECIDED TO CALL ""DIVIDEND GROWTH OR VALUE"" STOCKS (WHICH I ARGUE IS AN OVERSIMPLIFICATION).

THE CANADIAN INDICES HAVE BASICALLY DONE NOTHING, ESPECIALLY IN $USD$, SINCE 2008.  SO I'D EXPECT THEM TO SOLIDLY OUTPERFORM THE US IN A RECESSION.  

&GT;I'VE HEARD FOLKS SAY THEY WON'T TOUCH CHINESE OR EMERGING MARKETS UNTIL THE TRADE TENSIONS SIMMER, WOULD IT BE WISE IN YOUR OPINION TO FOLLOW THAT ADVICE?

VWO/EEM HAVE DONE NOTHING IN USD$ SINCE 2008.  SIMILAR DEAL.  

&GT;IS IT COMMON TO PARK A DECENT SUM OF MONEY IN A CLASSIC STOCK LIKE AMZN OR AAPL INSTEAD OF A BROAD ETF? IS THAT A HIGHER RISK HIGHER REWARD SCENARIO?

THOSE COMPANIES HAVE HAD THEIR DAYS IN THE SUN.  USUALLY AFTER A RECESSION, SOME OTHER SECTOR TAKES THE LEAD.  I'D CONSIDER THOSE COMPANIES TO BE INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS TO INVEST IN WITH LOW IMPLIED FUTURE RETURNS.

&GT;IS THE GENERAL CONSENSUS, THAT THE USD WILL MOST LIKELY RISE COMPARED TO THE CAD?

23,rodbarc123,CanadianInvestor,"IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHAT YOUR GOALS ARE WHEN INVESTING. NOT EVERY INVESTOR HAS THE SAME GOALS. MY GOAL IS TO LIVE OFF THE DIVIDENDS, SO I CAN HAVE PERPETUAL GROWTH INCOME WITHOUT THE NEED OF SELLING ANY SHARES - THIS WILL ALLOW ME TO REMAIN INVESTED AT ALL TIMES, INCLUDING DURING RECESSIONS. NOW, THIS ISTRATEGY REQUIRES PATIENCE AND TIME. I HOLD ALL THE NAMES THAT YOU MENTIONED BECAUSE THESE COMPANIES HAVE OUTSTANDING BALANCE SHEET AND STEADY CASH FLOW THAT ALLOWS DIVIDENDS TO GROW EVERY YEAR - EXACTLY WHAT I NEED WHEN DIVIDENDS REPLACE MY SALARY. BUT THESE COMPANIES ALSO UNDERPERFORM THE INDEX. I DON'T CARE, BECAUSE I WILL NEVER SELL MY SHARES (EXCEPT IF FUNDAMENTALS DETERIORATE), SO I DON'T NEED THE CAPITAL GAINS. IN 2008 AND 2001 I GOT A HIGHER INCOME THAN THE YEAR BEFORE, AND THAT'S MY PRIMARY GOAL (THE GROWTH OF INCOME THAT WILL REPLACE MY SALARY). 

THIS IS A DIFFERENT STRATEGY THAN GROWTH INVESTING, WHILE YOUR GOAL IS TO MAXIMIZE CAPITAL APPRECIATION. MOST OF GROWTH STOCKS DON'T PAY A DIVIDEND, BECAUSE CASH IS REINVESTED IN THE BUSINESS. THAT'S A COMPLETE DIFFERENT STRATEGY, AND MUCH HARDER IN MY OPINION, BECAUSE GROWTH COMPANIES ARE HARSHLY PENALIZED WHEN GROWTH SLOWS DOWN, WHICH IS ONLY A MATTER OF TIME.  I DO HOLD SOME GROWTH STOCKS IN CASE I NEED TO LIQUIDATE A LARGER PORTION OF MY PORTFOLIO FOR SOME EMERGENCY AND FOR SHORTER TERM GAINS. THE SCREENING METHOD IS A LOT DIFFERENT TOO, AS MANY OF THESE COMPANIES TRACK THEIR INTRINSIC VALUE BASED ON TOP-LINE NUMBERS LIKE EV TO PRICE OR SALES TO PRICE OR OPERATING CASH FLOW TO PRICE. HENCE STOCKS LIKE AMZN LOOK EXPENSIVE (FOR A DIVIDEND INVESTOR THAT TYPICALLY LOOK AT EARNINGS), WHILE THEY ARE NOT BECAUSE AMZN STOCK PRICE TRACKS OPERATING CASH FLOW. BUT WHEN A RECESSION PERIOD COMES, THOSE CAPITAL GAINS MIGHT NOT BE AVAILABLE. YOU NEED STRICTER RULES TO DECIDE IF THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THAT BUSINESS IS STILL WORTH. 

SO WHICH STRATEGY STYLE DO YOU PREFER? CAPITAL APPRECIATION AT THE EXPENSE OF A MORE INTENSE DUE DILIGENCE OR DIVIDEND GROWTH ON STABLE, MATURE AND BORING COMPANIES THAT WILL GIVE YOU A PERPETUAL GROWING STREAM OF INCOME WITH A SMALLER CAPITAL APPRECIATION?  I USE BOTH, AND EACH STRATEGY HAS A DIFFERENT TIME AND EFFORT INVOLVED, BUT YOU SHOULD DECIDE BASED ON YOUR GOALS. 

NOW THESE STRATEGIES ARE JUST HALF OF THE PUZZLE, TO DEFINE WHAT TO BUY. THE OTHER HALF IS WHEN TO BUY - NOT TIMING THE MARKET, BUT TO CALCULATE FAIR VALUATION BASED ON THE ESTIMATED EARNINGS GROWTH OR CASH FLOW GROWTH FOR THE BUSINESS THAT YOU ARE CONSIDERING. WHEN TO BUY IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT, BECAUSE A GREAT COMPANY CAN BE A TERRIBLE INVESTMENT IF YOU PAY TOO MUCH FOR IT. 

BOTH STRATEGIES SHOULD USE A VALUE INVESTING APPROACH TO HAVE A DECENT MARGIN OF SAFETY. EARNINGS AND VALUATION ARE THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF RETURN ON YOUR INVESTMENT. 

MY GOALS WHEN INVESTING ARE ORIENTED TOWARDS SAFETY, INCOME, AND CONSISTENCY. MANY COMPANIES FROM THE INDEX FAIL TO MEET THIS CRITERIA.  THEREFORE, I DON'T DO INDEX INVESTING, BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO BE INVESTED IN THESE COMPANIES.

THE OTHER FACTOR IS VALUATION - WHEN PURCHASING THE INDEX, I CANNOT CHOOSE TO BUY A COMPANY AT OR BELOW ITS INTRINSIC VALUE.  I NEED TO BUY THE WHOLE PACKAGE WITH ALL COMPANIES, WHICH WILL CONTAIN OVERVALUED COMPANIES TOO. BUYING ANY BUSINESS WHEN OVERVALUED DRAGS RETURN. HOWEVER, INDIVIDUAL INVESTING IS NOT FOR EVERYONE, SO ETFS ARE A CONVENIENT WAY TO GET EXPOSURE TO EQUITIES, BUT NOT OPTIMAL BECAUSE YOU CANNOT CONTROL QUALITY AND VALUATION ALIGNED TO YOUR GOALS.

THE OTHER COMPONENT THAT I USE FOR VALUATION (SPECIFIC FOR GROWTH COMPANIES) ARE TOP LINE NUMBERS, AS THE MORE YOU DRILL DOWN TOWARD THE TOP OF THE INCOME STATEMENT (P/S OR EV/S TYPE ITEMS) OR AT CATCHALLS LIKE ROE, THE BETTER ABLE YOU ARE TO WITHSTAND THE VARIETIES OF ACCOUNTING PRESENTATION FOR THESE COMPANIES.

IS THE STOCK A WEED STOCK, OR HIGH GROWTH SMALL CAP STOCK , &AMP; YOU COULD USE THE MONEY FOR SOMETHING ELSE, OR YOU WANT TO DEPLOY IT INTO VALUE ORIENTED STOCK AT THIS POINT IN THE CYCLE ......THEN THE ANSWER IS THAT YOU SHOULD SELL. 

IS THE STOCK AAPL, OR AMZN, OR OLLI, OR WYNN ETC ETC, THEN THE ANSWER IS A BIT MORE NUANCED &AMP; DEPENDS UPON YOUR PERSONAL OUTLOOK, INSTITUTIONAL CASH FLOWS, DEGREE OF RISK, TIME HORIZON ETC.   

BUT TO SIMPLY ASK:  “UP 100%, SHOULD I SELL?”  ?

28,TaserTester,CanadianInvestor,"17X EARNINGS IMPLIES INVESTORS ARE EXPECTING PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL EARNINGS GROWTH, THAT'S THE ONLY CONCERN TO ME..

I BELIEVE IN THEIR AGM THEY SAID THEY CAN GROW EPS 10% THROUGH 2020 (THOUGH THAT'LL BE JUICED BY BUY-BACKS). 

CANADIAN TIRE'S PEER GROUP ISN'T NFLX, AMZN OR SHOP, IT'S OTHER RETAILERS. I SEE A PURCHASE LIKE HELLY HANSEN FOR ALMOST $1B, THAT GENERATES MINIMAL EBIT FOR CTC AS A POTENTIAL HEADWIND. THAT'S ALMOST 7% OF THEIR MARKET-CAP THEY SHELLED OUT FOR A BRAND I DON'T SEE FITTING THEIR MODEL THAT WELL...

CTC IS TRYING TO GO GLOBAL... THEY NEED TO FOR THE HELLY PURCHASE TO MAKE SENSE. SO MANY CANADIAN RETAILERS HAVE FAILED TRYING TO DO A SIMILAR THING... INCLUDING CANADIAN TIRE PREVIOUSLY. 

THEY'RE GOING FROM THAT WIDE MOAT, CENTER OF SMALL TOWN BUSINESS (THAT WE LOVE) TO NO MOAT GLOBAL FASHION BUSINESSES. WHILE CERTAINLY NOT THE SAME MANAGEMENT TEAM OR SITUATION, LOOK AT HUDSON BAY'S EXPANSION INTO THE NETHERLANDS... THEY'RE BASHING THEIR BRAINS IN TRYING TO MAKE A NEWLY RENOVATED STORE-BASE IN A COUNTRY THAT LOVES CANADIANA WORK... AND THEY CAN'T. WHAT EXPERIENCE DOES CANADIAN TIRE HAVE LAUNCHING A GLOBAL BRAND?

30,BizyBeaver,CanadianInvestor,"FIRST OF ALL, TO /U/CYRILIX, I THINK AMAZON WILL IN FACT CONTINUE TO GROW AT LEAST THEIR PROFITS AT AN INSANE PACE GIVEN THAT THEY JUST INCREASED THEIR PRIME MEMBERSHIP COST BY 20% A FEW MONTHS AGO AND NOBODY BATTED AN EYE.  20% IS HUGE. AND THEY COULD DO THAT A COUPLE MORE TIMES I THINK AND STILL BE IN THE CLEAR. (EDIT: THERE'S ALSO A STAT I READ LAST YEAR THAT ONLY 42% OF AMERICANS BOUGHT SOMETHING OFF AMAZON...LOOKS LIKE IT MIGHT BE CLOSER TO 63% NOW THOUGH ACCORDING TO THIS [ARTICLE](HTTPS://WWW.NPR.ORG/ABOUT-NPR/617470695/NPR-MARIST-POLL-AMAZON-IS-A-COLOSSUS-IN-A-NATION-OF-SHOPPERS) WRITTEN A MONTH AGO)

WITH A PRIME MEMBERSHIP YOU GET THE BEST OF AMAZON ALONGSIDE A VIDEO SERVICE THAT'S SLOWLY BECOMING COMPETITIVE WITH NETFLIX, A DISCOUNTED MUSIC SERVICES THAT IS BECOMING COMPETITIVE WITH SPOTIFY, FREE NFL GAMES, TWITCH PRIME, AND HONESTLY SO MUCH MORE.  AMAZON PRIME INCLUDES SO MUCH THAT THEY CAN CHARGE A LOT FOR THE MEMBERSHIP.

AS FAR AS THE P/E DISCUSSION GOES, I WROTE ABOUT THIS IN MY BLOG A COUPLE MONTHS AGO.  I CAME UP WITH A UNIQUE ANALYSIS (WHICH COULD BE ENTIRELY FLAWED, BUT YOU TELL ME).  I NOTICED THAT ALL COMPARABLE COMPANIES, WHETHER IT BE WALMART, FACEBOOK, NVIDIA, ALL HAD CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS THAT WERE ABOUT 1.5 TIMES THEIR EARNINGS, WHEREAS AMAZON'S WERE ABOUT 6 TIMES!  I SPECULATED THAT THIS IS PERHAPS MANY OF THEIR ""CAPITAL EXPENDITURES"" ARE EXPENSED ON THE INCOME STATEMENT (REDUCING EARNINGS) RATHER THAN CAPITALIZED ON THE BALANCE SHEET, NOT TO MENTION AMORTIZATION (WHICH IS COUNTED AGAINST EARNINGS BUT NOT CASH FLOW) IS SOMETIMES A STICKY ISSUE, ESPECIALLY WITH SOFTWARE COMPANIES.  REGARDLESS, ALL INVESTORS AGREE CASH FLOW IS A BETTER METRIC THAN EARNINGS.

SO SINCE, AS /U/INVESTTHERESTPLS POINTED OUT, PEG IS SUCH A COMMON METRIC TO USE, I ""NORMALIZED"" AMAZON'S FORWARD P/E OF 125 (IT'S NOW 145, BUT I'VE BEEN USING OLD NUMBERS THIS WHOLE ANALYSIS), BY MULTIPLYING IT BY 1.5/6, RESULTING IN A FORWARD P/E OF ~31.

THEIR GROWTH RATE IN RECENT YEARS HAS BEEN ~43%, AND ACCORDING TO ""ANALYSTS"" IT'S EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT 30% OVER THE NEXT 3-5 YEARS, SO THIS RESULTS IN A *NORMALIZED* PEG OF ABOUT 1, ALTHOUGH IT WOULD PROBABLY BE HIGHER NOW.

IN CONCLUSION, I SAID THAT IF I HAD TO PICK 3 MAJOR (PROFITABLE) TECH COMPANIES TO INVEST IN IT WOULD BE CSU, FB, AND AMZN, BUT ADMITTEDLY I OWN A VARIETY OF OTHER TECH COMPANIES INSTEAD OF AMZN CAUSE, AS /U/INVESTTHERESTPLS IMPLIED, YOU CAN'T BEAT THE MARKET BY OWNING THE MARKET, AND AMAZON IS A GLOBAL BEHEMOTH AT THIS POINT.

I GUESS PEG IS A LOT BETTER. AND PEG SHOWS AMZN AT ~4.5, DIS AND MSFT AT ~2 AND ~2.5.

HIGHER P/E MAKES SENSE WHEN YOU EVALUATE A COMPANY AS GROWING WELL - TO A POINT. LOWER FOR FAIRLY STAGNANT ONES.

THEY STILL HAVE ROOM FOR GROWTH IN AWS CLOUD, OVERSEAS, PRIME (TELEVISION), PRIME MEMBERS WILL HAVE DISCOUNTS AT WHOLE FOODS, THEY ARE GETTING INTO PRESCRIPTION DRUG DELIVERY AND SWITCHES AND ROUTERS.  THEY ARE EVEN BEGINNING TALKS ABOUT A SPACE PROGRAM TO MESS WITH MUSK.  50% OF EVERYTHING BOUGHT ONLINE IS THROUGH AMZN.

35,MaliciousLegroomMelo,CanadianInvestor,"IF YOU WOULD HAVE ASKED THAT 1 MONTH, 3 MONTHS, 6 MONTHS, 12 MONTHS AGO THE INFORMED ANSWER WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME AS TODAY:

AAPL, MSFT, GOOG ARE REAL BUSINESSES WITH SUPERB FUNDAMENTALS AND HUGE MARKET SHARE AND MOATS.  

NFLX (AND AMZN TO A LESS DEGREE) ARE MORE SPECULATIVE, WITH LITTLE TO NO EARNINGS, INSANE MULTIPLES, LOTS OF SPENDING, AND WALKING AROUND WITH TARGETS ON THEIR BACKS FROM COMPETITORS.  

EVEN SO, NFLX AND AMZN WOULD HAVE KILLED IT OVER THOSE TIME FRAMES VERSUS THE MORE SENSIBLE AND ANALYTICAL CHOICES.

THE WAY NETFLIX SPENDS SEEMS CRAZY TO ME, THEY DON'T ACTUALLY MAKE MONEY (IF YOU USE STANDARD ACCOUNTING INSTEAD OF THEIR FUNKY METHODS) AND I CAN'T IMAGINE WHO IS THEIR INCREMENTAL NEW SUBSCRIBER AS PRETTY MUCH ANYONE WHO WANTS NETFLIX SURELY ALREADY HAS IT.   

EVEN SO, IT'S DOUBLE AGAIN RECENTLY.  SO THE FUNDAMENTALS HAVEN'T REALLY MATTERED, IT'S JUST ABOUT WHAT OTHER BUYERS (IE GREATER FOOLS) THINK.
