1,johnnychi,CanadianInvestor,"I HAVE BEEN WORRIED IN THE BACK OF MY MIND ABOUT THIS POLITICAL FOOTBALL. I THINK THE HUAWEI ISSUE IS A POLITICAL FOOTBALL AND NOT A NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE. WAS THERE EXPLICIT PROOF ASIDE FROM ""IT'S CHINESE"" AND ""THE CHINESE ARE ALL EVIL SO THEIR COMPANIES MUST BE DOING WHAT EVERY OTHER TECHNOLOGY COMPANY IS LIKELY DOING AS WELL""? (TO MAKE IT SIMPLE INSTEAD OF LISTING THEM SUCH AS INTEL BACKDOORS CISCO ROUTERS, AT&AMP;T SECRET INSTALLATION, ETC. JUST LOOK UP SNOWDEN.)

&AMP;#X200B;

REMEMBER THE ""CHINESE INSTALLED CHIPS THAT CAN BYPASS YOUR PROTECTIONS"" SCAREMONGERING THAT FIZZLED IN A FEW DAYS AFTER BOTH AAPL AND AMZN DEMANDED BLOOMBERG RETRACT THEIR STORY FOR A LACK OF PROOF. EVEN SECURITY EXPERTS DID NOT AGREE WITH THE HIT PIECE. I WAS TAKEN INTO IT, BUT AFTER SEEING THE RESULTING FALLOUT NOW HAVE DOUBTS AND CONTINUE TO THINK WE ARE BEING INFLUENCED FOR SOME GROUPS' POLITICAL GAINS.

DURING A FAIRLY RECENT INTERVIEW WITH THE BCE CEO I DID DETECT A CHANGE IN VOICE WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE IMPACT OF HUAWEI.

3,langlois44,CanadianInvestor,"OF COURSE NOT.

/U/JUGWHATEVER GAVE YOU A WHOLE BUNCH OF STOCKS WHICH COULD BE DESCRIBED AS ""GROWTH STOCKS"" (THOUGH I'M AGAINST THE NEEDLESS CATEGORIZATION OF STOCKS). THERE ARE DOZENS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF OTHER COMPANIES WITH LONG TRACK RECORDS OF GROWING REVENUES, EARNINGS, AND THEIR SHARE PRICE. JUST BECAUSE YOU DON'T SEE THEM, OR CHOOSE TO CATEGORIZE THEM AS SOMETHING ELSE, DOESN'T MEAN THERE ISN'T ANY GROWTH IN THE CANADIAN MARKETS. 

* THERE ARE LOTS OF MINING STOCKS WHICH ARE NOT PUMP AND DUMPS, REGARDLESS OF YOUR FEELINGS. THEY'RE NOT FOR EVERYONE, BUT THERE ARE MANY SUCH STOCKS GROWING LIKE GANGBUSTERS, WITH REAL ASSETS WHICH SELL REAL GOODS.
* WHERE ARE RETAIL OR CONSUMER STOCKS IN YOUR CLASSIFICATIONS? LOOK AT CANADIAN TIRE, CANADA GOOSE, ALIMENTATION COUCHE-TARD, MTY, ETC.
* WITHOUT THE NEED TO CLASSIFY COMPANIES INTO SECTORS - SJ, CN, CP, BAM.A, IFC, LNR, DRM, MEQ, CAR.UN, PIF, GUD, MRC, IAM, PLC, GSY, BUS, MG, DAP.U, PBL, ETC. SOME OF THESE YOU MIGHT DISMISS AS ""VALUE"" OR ""DIVIDEND GROWTH"" BUT IF THEY'VE BEEN GROWING EARNINGS AT 10+% A YEAR, IT'S RIDICULOUS TO DISMISS THEM AS NOT ""GROWTH"" STOCKS.

IN YOUR REPLY TO /U/JUGWHATEVER, YOU SAY: 

&GT;  I AGREE THAT THERE IS CERTAINLY GROWTH TO BE HAD IN CANADA, BUT IT'S  NOTHING LIKE THE US. I LOOKED AT SOME OF THE COMPANIES YOU LISTED, AND  OVERALL NOT TOO IMPRESSED COMPARED TO U.S GROWTH. 

TALK ABOUT MOVING THE GOAL POSTS. ""OKAY FINE, THERE IS GROWTH IN CANADIAN STOCKS, BUT NOT AS MUCH AS IN THE US!"" SURE, NOBODY HERE WILL ARGUE THAT. BUT YOU REALIZE THE POPULATION OF THE POPULATION OF THE US IS 10X OF CANADA'S? WHY WOULD WE HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT OF GROWTH STOCKS AS THEM?  

AND SECOND, HOW MUCH OF THE US' GROWTH ARE YOU ATTRIBUTING TO A FEW OUTLIERS? WHEN THE US MARKET IS PREDOMINANTLY AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, AND MSFT, AND THEY'VE HAD A LOT OF STOCKS GROW WELL PAST THEIR INTRINSIC VALUE (NFLX, TSLA, ETC), OBVIOUSLY THE US WILL LOOK LIKE IT HAS GREATER GROWTH.  

IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU'VE FALLEN VICTIM TO THE AVAILABILITY HEURISTIC. US STOCKS ARE COVERED MORE IN THE MEDIA, ON REDDIT, IN FORUMS, ETC MAKING THEIR GROWTH STOCKS VERY EASY TO RECALL. IT IS EASIER TO MAKE AN ERRONEOUS BLANKET STATEMENT LIKE ""YOU CAN'T BE A GROWTH INVESTOR IN CANADIAN STOCKS"" THAN IT IS TO SPEND HOURS RESEARCHING POLLARD BANKNOTE OR XPEL TECHNOLOGIES. WHEN STOCKS HAVE GROWN A LOT BUT ARE STILL CHEAP (LINAMAR, MAGNA, MORGUARD) IT IS EASY TO SAY ""NAH, THOSE ARE VALUE STOCKS - WHO CARES IF THEY'VE GROWN A LOT - THE P/E IS 6X!"" 

THE BIGGEST AND EASIEST STOCKS TO THINK OF IN THE US CAN REASONABLY BE CALLED ""GROWTH STOCKS"", WHEREAS THE BIGGEST AND EASIEST STOCKS TO THINK OF IN CANADA ARE BANKS, FORTIS, BCE, ETC, WHAT YOU'VE DECIDED TO CALL ""DIVIDEND GROWTH OR VALUE"" STOCKS (WHICH I ARGUE IS AN OVERSIMPLIFICATION).

THE CANADIAN INDICES HAVE BASICALLY DONE NOTHING, ESPECIALLY IN $USD$, SINCE 2008.  SO I'D EXPECT THEM TO SOLIDLY OUTPERFORM THE US IN A RECESSION.  

&GT;I'VE HEARD FOLKS SAY THEY WON'T TOUCH CHINESE OR EMERGING MARKETS UNTIL THE TRADE TENSIONS SIMMER, WOULD IT BE WISE IN YOUR OPINION TO FOLLOW THAT ADVICE?

VWO/EEM HAVE DONE NOTHING IN USD$ SINCE 2008.  SIMILAR DEAL.  

&GT;IS IT COMMON TO PARK A DECENT SUM OF MONEY IN A CLASSIC STOCK LIKE AMZN OR AAPL INSTEAD OF A BROAD ETF? IS THAT A HIGHER RISK HIGHER REWARD SCENARIO?

THOSE COMPANIES HAVE HAD THEIR DAYS IN THE SUN.  USUALLY AFTER A RECESSION, SOME OTHER SECTOR TAKES THE LEAD.  I'D CONSIDER THOSE COMPANIES TO BE INCREDIBLY DANGEROUS TO INVEST IN WITH LOW IMPLIED FUTURE RETURNS.

&GT;IS THE GENERAL CONSENSUS, THAT THE USD WILL MOST LIKELY RISE COMPARED TO THE CAD?

USD$ STRENGTH IS SELF-LIMITING, THE US TRADE DEFICITS ARE NOT INDEFINITELY SUSTAINABLE.  

&GT;IN MY YOUNG 20'S AM I BETTER OFF CHOOSING NON-DIVIDEND-FOCUSED ETFS? ASSUMING I DON'T PRESSINGLY NEED THE RECURRING MONEY.

I'M A FAN OF TAKING 70-80% OF YOUR MONEY, STICKING IT IN BROAD-MARKET ETFS, AND TAKING THE OTHER 20-30% AND INVESTING IT INTO THE SORTS OF THINGS YOU THINK ARE UNDERVALUED.  TOO MANY, PARTICULARLY YOUNGER PEOPLE, PUT IT ALL INTO SOME FAD STOCK, GET BURNED, AND THEN NEVER INVEST AGAIN IN THEIR LIFETIMES.

34,MaliciousLegroomMelo,CanadianInvestor,"IF YOU WOULD HAVE ASKED THAT 1 MONTH, 3 MONTHS, 6 MONTHS, 12 MONTHS AGO THE INFORMED ANSWER WOULD HAVE BEEN THE SAME AS TODAY:

AAPL, MSFT, GOOG ARE REAL BUSINESSES WITH SUPERB FUNDAMENTALS AND HUGE MARKET SHARE AND MOATS.  

NFLX (AND AMZN TO A LESS DEGREE) ARE MORE SPECULATIVE, WITH LITTLE TO NO EARNINGS, INSANE MULTIPLES, LOTS OF SPENDING, AND WALKING AROUND WITH TARGETS ON THEIR BACKS FROM COMPETITORS.  

EVEN SO, NFLX AND AMZN WOULD HAVE KILLED IT OVER THOSE TIME FRAMES VERSUS THE MORE SENSIBLE AND ANALYTICAL CHOICES.

THE WAY NETFLIX SPENDS SEEMS CRAZY TO ME, THEY DON'T ACTUALLY MAKE MONEY (IF YOU USE STANDARD ACCOUNTING INSTEAD OF THEIR FUNKY METHODS) AND I CAN'T IMAGINE WHO IS THEIR INCREMENTAL NEW SUBSCRIBER AS PRETTY MUCH ANYONE WHO WANTS NETFLIX SURELY ALREADY HAS IT.   

EVEN SO, IT'S DOUBLE AGAIN RECENTLY.  SO THE FUNDAMENTALS HAVEN'T REALLY MATTERED, IT'S JUST ABOUT WHAT OTHER BUYERS (IE GREATER FOOLS) THINK.

42,jaug1,CanadianInvestor,"CROCODILE DUNDEE BASICALLY LAID OUT EVERYTHING YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT INVESTING IN CANADA.

I WOULD ONLY ADD NORBERT'S GAMBIT IS AN INEXPENSIVE WAY TO CONVERT CAD TO USD (AND VICE VERSA). THERE ARE [WRITTEN](HTTPS://WWW.PWLCAPITAL.COM/EN/ADVISOR/TORONTO/TORONTO-TEAM/BLOG/JUSTIN-BENDER/FEBRUARY-2017/NORBERT-S-GAMBIT-AT-BMO-INVESTORLINE) AND [VIDEO](HTTPS://WWW.YOUTUBE.COM/WATCH?V=PIDDITOCQQ8) TUTORIALS ONLINE FOR DOING THIS WITH BMO.

AN ADVANTAGE TO INVESTING WITH USD IS THAT YOU GET ACCESS TO US-LISTED STOCKS AND ETFS. THE US-LISTED ETFS FOR WHICH THERE IS AN EQUIVALENT IN CANADA TEND TO BE MARGINALLY CHEAPER BUT THERE ARE MANY US-LISTED ETFS THAT JUST AREN’T AVAILABLE IN CANADA (SINGLE COUNTRY MARKETS, SECTOR SPECIALIZATION, ESG, ETC). 

THE BIGGER ADVANTAGE IS THAT THERE ARE PROBABLY MORE VARIETY OF US “BLUE CHIP” COMPANIES (ESPECIALLY TECH) THAT INTEREST YOU AS INVESTMENTS, LIKE APPLE (AAPL), GOOGLE (GOOGL), FACEBOOK (FB), ETC. YOU CAN GET TINY SLICES OF THESE THROUGH ETFS (ALONG WITH THOUSANDS OF OTHER COMPANIES AT THE SAME TIME, WHICH IS GOOD). BUT IF YOU WANT TO FOLLOW YOUR DAD'S APPROACH BY SELECTING SINGLE COMPANIES THEN YOU MIGHT WANT TO INCREASE THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO YOU.

ALL THAT SAID, I WOULD RECOMMEND STICKING TO ETFS UNTIL YOU’VE DEVELOPED SOME SKILL AT SECURITY ANALYSIS. EITHER WAY, I SUGGEST READING A FEW BOOKS ON INVESTING, LIKE *MILLIONAIRE TEACHER* BY ANDREW HALLAM (CANADIAN AUTHOR) AND *THE LITTLE BOOK OF COMMON SENSE INVESTING* BY JOHN C. BOGLE (AMERICAN AUTHOR, STARTED VANGUARD).
