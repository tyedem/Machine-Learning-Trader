11,summer_run,CanadianInvestor,"TD WILL BUY BACK THEIR SHARES ON THE OPEN MARKET. AS FOR YOUR OTHER QUESTION, IT DEPENDS WHO YOU ASK. A LONG TERM DIVIDEND GROWTH INVESTOR PROBABLY WON'T LIKE THEM AS THEY WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE THE SURPLUS CASH BE PAID OUT AS DIVIDENDS OR REINVESTED INTO THE BUSINESS (TO INCREASE PROFITS THAT ENABLE MORE DIVIDEND GROWTH). TOM CONNOLLY DESPISES THEM.

BUYBACKS FAVOUR EXECUTIVES (AND OTHERS) WITH COMPENSATION PACKAGES THAT ARE TIED TO EPS OR SOME OTHER PERFORMANCE METRIC WHERE AN ACCRETIVE ACQUISITION BOOSTS THEIR COMPENSATION LEVEL WHILE AT THE SAME TIME, OTHER KEY PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL HEALTH METRICS CAN UNDERPERFORM. THEY ALSO FAVOUR SHORT TERM INVESTORS/SPECULATORS. A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THIS IS ICAHN'S POSITION IN AAPL BETWEEN 2013 AND 2016 AND HIS RELENTLESS PRESSURE AS AN ACTIVIST INVESTOR ON TIM COOK AND THE BOARD TO SPEND THEIR CASH ON BUYBACKS.

ANOTHER REASON NOT TO LIKE BUYBACKS IS THAT COMPANIES ARE NOTORIOUSLY BAD AT TIMING THEIR PURCHASES AND THEY DON'T NECESSARILY LEAD TO A HIGHER STOCK PRICE. IBM'S BUYBACK PROGRAM OVER THE LAST 15 YEARS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THAT.",den92vd,t3_5xdiya,1488938544,1488963744.0,
